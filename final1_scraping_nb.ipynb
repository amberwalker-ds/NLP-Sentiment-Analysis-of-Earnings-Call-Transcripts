      "The first CEO Text from the dataset is: Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin today, I would like to first acknowledge the devastating events taking place in the Middle East. The horrific terrorist attacks on Israel over two weeks ago have no place in a civilized society. The scale and the barbarity of those attacks should shock us all and brings the situation in the Middle East to a very dangerous low. We are heartbroken at the loss of so many innocent lives then and in the war that continues this day. Our thoughts are with all who have been impacted, including many members of our own team. I would also like to recognize the incredible effort from our shoreside teams and crew, aboard Rhapsody of the Seas, who have been working tirelessly with the U.S. Department of State to help safely evacuate Americans from Israel. My heartfelt gratitude goes out to all involved. As it relates to the impact of these events on our business, about 1.5% of our capacity in the fourth quarter had planned to visit Israel. Most of the impacted deployment was quickly adjusted, including a few sailings that were home porting in Haifa. The evacuation services of Rhapsody of the Seas provided pro bono to the U.S. government, and these costs are included in our financial forecasts. Combined with canceled and adjusted itineraries in the region for the remainder of the year, the impact amounts to about $0.05 in earnings per share. Now, moving on to the business. Our teams have done an outstanding job delivering on another strong quarter as we delivered a yield improvement of close to 17% and beat the midpoint of our EPS guidance by 12%. This beat is further solidifying 2023 as a banner year in positioning us extremely well for 2024 and beyond. I want to thank the entire Royal Caribbean Group team whose enthusiasm and dedication enables us to deliver the very best vacation experiences responsibly while generating strong financial results. During the third quarter, all key itineraries exceeded our already elevated expectations as we delivered a record 2 million memorable vacations and exceptional guest satisfaction scores. As you can see on Slide 3, we had record yields for the quarter driven by new hardware, record pricing in the Caribbean and Europe, as well as onboard revenue rates that were up about 30%. While the performance of our Caribbean itineraries has been excellent throughout the year, we were particularly pleased with the double-digit yield growth achieved on our European itineraries in the third quarter. As we look to the full year, the strong performance in the third quarter and continued acceleration in the booking environment is positioning us well to deliver over 13% yield growth for the year and earnings per share that is twice our original guidance for the year. The unprecedented acceleration in demand and pricing for our leading brands, combined with stronger demand for onboard experiences, were certainly the main drivers of our outperformance. Adding to that, our strong focus on cost has been an important contributing factor to our elevated 2023 results. The healthy demand environment is very encouraging as we continue to build the business for 2024 and beyond. A year ago, we announced a three-year financial performance program, Trifecta. Our teams have rallied around to Trifecta targets, focusing on generating strong quality demand enhancing margins, building for the future and most of all, delivering the best vacations in the world. As you can see from our results, we are well on our way to achieving Trifecta. Our proven formula for success remains unchanged. Moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth, although I would not describe this year as moderate, and strong cost controls lead to enhanced margins, profitability, and superior financial performance. As I've said in the past, Trifecta creates the pathway back to what we internally describe as base camp. However, base camp is not our final destination, and our ambitions go well beyond it. As we think about 2024 for the Royal Caribbean Group from a consumer demand standpoint, we look to both macro trends and data points from the millions of daily customer interactions. On a macro level, some of the economic indicators continue to provide some conflicting signals. However, when we look closer at these trends, and indicators related to our customers and their related behaviors and strong propensity to cruise, we see that many of these macro indicators are less relevant to our business. We have more than 130,000 guests sailing on our ships every day and millions more who book or engage with us throughout our commercial platforms. What we continue to see across all markets, brands, and products is an exceptionally engaged consumer that is looking to book their dream vacations with us. The positioning of our brands attract guests across broad demographics, psychographics, and at-a-median household income of at least $125,000. Our customers' sentiment is bolstered by strong labor markets, high wages, surplus savings, and elevated wealth levels. Even better for us is the fact that overall spend on experiences continue to grow and is currently up 25% compared to 2019, with twice the amount spent on goods. Cruising remains an exceptional value proposition with strong demographics and secular tailwinds, allowing us to outperform the broader leisure travel industry. Our goal is to further narrow the gap to land-based vacations as we attract even more satisfied customers to our vacation ecosystem. I believe that is why when people are raising concerns in other industries like hotel, airline, real estate. Our commercial apparatus is firing on all cylinders with visits to our websites in the third quarter, doubling that of 2019. Our travel partners are also delivering meaningfully more bookings than 2019 levels and even beating our elevated expectations. Our brand's global appeal and nimble sourcing model allows us to attract the highest yielding guests and partially mitigate the impact from the stronger dollar. Now, I'll focus on 2024, which is shaping up to be another incredible year for the Royal Caribbean Group. Our capacity is growing by 8%, and our deployment across markets is relatively consistent with 2023 with slightly more Caribbean, slightly less Europe, and a return to China for the first time in 4 years. Demand for 2024 has continued to accelerate with bookings consistently outpacing 2019 levels by a wide margin. This has resulted in a booked position that is ahead of all prior years at higher rates further positioning us for another year of strong yield and earnings growth. While still early, we anticipate making significant progress toward our trifecta goals in 2024. And based on current fuel FX and interest rates, we anticipate earnings that will start with at least a $9 handle. Our operating platform is larger and stronger than it has ever been with the best brands, the most innovative fleet and destinations, and the best people. Each of our brand is the leader within their category. Royal Caribbean International dominates the contemporary market; Celebrity Cruises has redefined the premium travel space, and no one delivers ultra-luxury and expedition at sea like Silversea. By combining their unique strengths, we have created an attractive vacation ecosystem in which the sum is greater than the parts. Essentially, we are turning our delivery of a vacation of a lifetime into a lifetime of vacations. We will continue to ensure that each brand has what it needs to continue doing what it does best, while leveraging our enhanced commercial capabilities to capture and keep customers in our ecosystem. From young families to empty nesters as they seek to return to us time and time again for the best vacation experiences. Our innovative new ships and onboard experiences allow us to continue to differentiate our offerings as well as deliver superior yields and margins. In August, we welcomed Silver Nova, the first of the new evolution class for our Silversea brand. In the next few weeks, Celebrity Cruises will take delivery of Celebrity Ascent. And Royal Caribbean International will take delivery of the game-changing Icon of the Seas later this quarter with revenue sailings beginning at the end of January. In 2024, we plan to take delivery of Utopia of the Seas for Royal Caribbean International and Silver Ray for Silversea. With each new ship, we raised the bar in the travel industry while enhancing what our guests already know and love. Also debuting in January 2024, just in time for the arrival of Icon of the Seas is Hideaway Beach. Hideaway Beach is our newest adult-only ultimate beachfront paradise at Perfect Day at CocoCay. Pre-cruise sales for Hideaway Beach and premium offerings are exceeding our expectations. We are further enhancing our commerce capabilities to optimize our distribution channels, build even more customer loyalty, and lower our acquisition costs. We have seen a significant increase in new to brand and new-to-cruise customers this year. In fact, in the third quarter, approximately two-thirds of our guests were new to cruise or new to brand, all while also doubling the repeat booking rate, indicating strong loyalty and satisfaction. We've continued to remove friction and make it easier than ever for guests to prebook their activities with about a third of those purchases now coming through the mobile app. In the third quarter, about 70% of guests made pre-cruise purchases at much higher APDs than in prior years. In the third quarter, customers who purchased onboard experiences before their cruise spend 2.5 times more than those who only bought once on board. As we look into 2024, we have booked over double the amount of pre-cruise revenue compared to this year with more guests engaging before their cruise and at higher prices. We will continue to excel in the core and drive business excellence in order to increase yields and capture efficiencies across our platform. I said it before, but it's worth mentioning again, our formula for success remains unchanged. Moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost controls will lead to enhanced margins, profitability, and superior financial performance. Our sustainability ambitions help inform our strategic and financial decisions on a daily basis, ensuring that we always act responsibly while achieving our long-term profitability goals. We are making progress on our SEA the Future commitments to sustain the planet, energize communities, and accelerate innovation. We are also progressing toward a double-digit reduction in carbon intensity versus 2019 by 2025 and are exploring multiple options for low carbon-based solutions for our existing fleet while we design the fleet of the future with flexibility in mind. This past quarter, we concluded a 12-week biofuel trial program in Europe, a first in the industry to cover multiple fuel types in multiple operating areas. The trials resulted in a 20% carbon reduction while also helping to better understand supply chain dynamics. The decision that we are making now will help position us to deliver a net zero ship by 2035 and achieve our climate strategy of Destination Net Zero. Our business is performing exceptionally well, and we are making significant progress toward achieving Trifecta goals. The future of the Royal Caribbean Group is bright with our strong platform and proven strategies, we are creating a lifetime of vacation experiences for our customers while also delivering long-term shareholder value that allows us to reach new financial records. With that, I will turn it over to Naftali. Naf? \n"

      "The first CEO Text from the dataset is: Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with third-quarter results. Our teams delivered another strong performance with adjusted earnings per share of $3.85, 12% higher than the midpoint of our July guidance. We finished the third quarter with a load factor of 110%. And with net yields, they were up almost 17% versus 2019, about 300 basis points higher than the midpoint of our July guidance. Overall, about 50% of the better-than-expected yield performance was driven by European itineraries with the remainder mainly driven by Caribbean and Alaska. Rates were up approximately 18% in the third quarter compared to '19, and onboard APDs have been consistently higher even as load factors return to historical levels. NCC, excluding fuel, increased 10.3% compared to the third quarter of 2019, 100 basis points lower than our July guidance. Lower operating costs, as well as favorable timing, contributed to the better-than-expected costs. Our teams continue to deliver strong top line growth while maintaining focus on costs to expand our margin. We delivered an EBITDA margin of nearly 42% in the third quarter, on par with 2019 levels. Over 100% of the revenue outperformance during the quarter dropped to the broad bottom line, leading to higher adjusted EBITDA and earnings versus expectations. We continue to see strong demand and pricing for both 2023 and 2024 sailings. This has resulted in higher-than-expected load factors and record yields in the third quarter, along with a record booked position on a forward-looking basis. Now that we are in the fourth quarter, many of our ships have transitioned from their summer to their winter itineraries. In the fourth quarter, about 55% of our capacity will be in the Caribbean, 11% in Europe, and about 13% in the Asia Pacific region. The remaining capacity is spread across a number of other itineraries, including repositionings, South America, and Expedition Cruises. Now, let's turn to Slide 6 to talk about our guidance for the full year 2023. We now expect net yield growth of 12.9% to 13.4% for the full year, a 140-basis-point increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up 7% to 7.5% for the full year as compared to '19. Our cost outlook has not changed from our July guidance. We do, however, have slightly fewer APCDs due to the canceled sailings that included Israel impacting NCCx by approximately 30 basis points. Our cost outlook reflects the continued benefit from all the actions we have taken over the last several years to support enhanced margins. We continue to expect record adjusted EBITDA per APCD for the year and an EBITDA margin that is back to our previous record in 2019. So, in summary, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $6.58 to $6.63, and it includes approximately $0.21 negative impact from FX and fuel rates as well as sailings that included Israel. Now, turning to Slide 7, I will discuss our fourth quarter guidance. Fourth quarter yields are expected to be up approximately 16.2% to 16.7%, driven by our incredible new hardware and a significant increase in rates, both ticket and chipboard for like-for-like ships. This range also includes about 200 basis points negative impact from the elimination of the reporting lag related to Silversea. NCC, excluding fuel, is expected to be up 3.9% to 4.4% and including 60 basis points impact from sailings that included Israel related to reduced APCDs. As for adjusted earnings per share, we expect a range of $1.05 to $1.10 for the fourth quarter. This also includes $0.18 negative impact from FX and fuel rates as well as sailings that included Israel. Now, I will share insights for 2024, which while still early, is shaping up to be another exciting year for the company. 2024 capacity is expected to be up 8% as we introduce Icon, Utopia, and Silver Ray and benefit from a full year of Ascent and Silver Nova. Capacity growth is most pronounced in the first and the third quarters due to the timing of new ship deliveries and timing of dry docks. Our Caribbean capacity is growing about 13% in 2024 and will represent about 55% of overall deployment. We are adding a full year of Icon of the Seas and about seven months of short Caribbean sailings on Utopia. We also expect to increase the number of guests experiencing Perfect Day at CocoCay with the addition of Hideaway Beach. As a result, we expect a total of 3 million guests will experience Perfect Day in 2024, up from 2.5 million this year. European itineraries will account for 15% of our capacity in 2024. Alaska will account for about 6%. And Asia Pacific itineraries will account for 10%, marking our return to China with Spectrum of the Seas in Q2 of next year. Capacity for itineraries to visit Israel account for less than 1.5% in 2024. As Jason mentioned, both our booked load factors and APDs are higher than all previous years. This is despite having more short Caribbean itineraries in China, which typically book closer in. There are a few factors that are expected to influence the cadence of our yield growth throughout 2024. In addition to the typical variability driven by the timing of new ship deliveries, the return to normal load factors in the first half of the year will bolster our year-over-year yield growth in comparison to the back half. The first quarter will also benefit from the annualization of pricing power that accelerated during wave this year. Now, moving to costs. Our focus remains to control costs as we seek to grow our revenue and margins. We also continue to benefit from all the actions that we have taken in the last few years to reshape our cost structure. In 2024, we expect to have double the dry dock days compared to this year because of timing of dry docks throughout the pandemic. In addition, we are launching Hideaway Beach at Perfect Day at CocoCay that while it is accretive to margin, has no APCDs associated with it, further impacting cost comparisons. We expect the increased dry dock days and the opening of Hideaway Beach to negatively impact NCCx by approximately 300 basis points next year. Outside of that, we expect cost to increase very low single digits, consistent with our proven formula. We will provide more details on the financial impact of these items during our fourth-quarter earnings call. The combination of our strong book position and an accelerating demand environment is certainly pointing to another year of solid yield growth and a step change in earnings growth as we accelerate toward our Trifecta goals. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in liquidity. Strengthening the balance sheet continues to be a top priority. Better-than-expected cash flow generation and our disciplined capital allocation has allowed us to accelerate reduction in leverage and debt levels with the goal of achieving investment-grade balance sheet metrics. Utilizing cash flow from operations, we repaid $775 million of debt during the quarter, including 500 million of our 11.5% senior secured notes due June 2025. In October, we refinanced our 3 billion revolving credit facility and 500 million term loan into a new 3.5 billion multiyear revolving credit facility. The successful execution of the new credit facility demonstrates the continued support and confidence in the company's financial position and credit improvement. Also in October, we issued a redemption notice for the remaining 500 million of our 11.5% secured notes due June 2025. This redemption will be funded with existing liquidity. With that, we expect to pay off over $3.5 billion of debt and reduce leverage to mid four times by the end of the year. Debt paydown actions reduced interest expense by close to $100 million in 2023 compared to our initial expectations and contribute to further increase in earnings going forward as we chip away at our high-cost debt. Our commitment to strengthening the balance sheet is also being recognized by the credit agencies. In the third quarter, S&P upgraded our credit rating by two notches to BB- and Moody's upgraded our credit rating by one notch to B1 with a positive outlook. As the business accelerates and generates more cash flow, we'll continue to proactively and methodically pay down debt and pursue opportunistic refinancings in support of our Trifecta goals. In closing, we remain committed and focused on executing on our strategy and delivering our mission while achieving our Trifecta goals. With that, I will ask our operator to open the call for a question-and-answer session. \n"

      "The first CEO Text from the dataset is: Well, thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. I want to welcome everyone to our fourth-quarter earnings call. It's such a great time to be in the cruise industry with wonderful new products available across all three of our award-winning brands. The demand for cruise vacations is certainly as robust as we have ever seen it. And the continued innovation on board is leading to outstanding financial performance and exceptional guest satisfaction scores and guest repeat rates. Today, it's my pleasure to discuss some of our key milestones in 2023, our progress on our near-term priorities, recent booking trends, and our outlook for 2024. Later in the call, I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide more color on our 2023 performance and guidance for 2024. Now, 2023 can best be described as a landmark year for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. We started the year on the heels of the last of the impact from COVID and the last of the cruise ports reopening in the Asia Pacific region throughout Q1. But as you can see on Slide 5, consumer demand was quick to rebound in full, and we were pleased to return to full ships and full year profitability. It is so incredibly rewarding for our staff and crew to be able to operate full ships and deliver vacation experiences of a lifetime to our happy guests. While that in and of itself would have made for a spectacular 2023, we were further going by the introduction of three new world-class ships into our fleet, one for each of our three award-winning brands. This was an unprecedented achievement and a first in the 57-year history of our company. We welcomed Oceania Cruises Vista in May, Norwegian Viva in August, and most recently, the highly anticipated Regent Seven Seas Grandeur in November. The successful launch of three vessels in one year would not have been possible without the hard work and unwavering commitment of crew and team members across the globe. Thanks to their dedication and passion for providing an unmatched guest experience, the reception for these new ships continues to be overwhelmingly positive across the board. This reception, combined with the strong demand environment we continue to experience across all three of our brands, has enabled us to successfully absorb an 18% increase in capacity in 2023 versus 2019 levels at record pricing levels. As a result, we have driven revenue per passenger cruise day up 17%, allowing us to finish the year with year-end advanced ticket sales of $3.2 billion, up an incredible 56% compared to 2019. At the same time, we continue to maximize onboard revenue generation, as shown by growth onboard revenue per passenger cruise day, which is up 27% over 2019. A main driver of this large improvement is through enhanced presold onboard revenue, so our guests come on board with a fresh wallet. But none of this is new news. As we have been and continue to be the industry leader in net yields, we are proud of the work our teams do day in and day out to drive the highest yields in the industry. But today, I also want to emphasize that we are equally passionate about the cost side of the business. Our relentless focus on cost optimization has produced four sequential quarters of year-over-year adjusted new -- of year-over-year adjusted net cruise cost per capacity day reduction with full year 2023 coming in 21% lower than the prior year. We achieved this by focusing our efforts on optimizing spend and investments across all areas of the business, from fuel to food and consumables and marketing. We are committed to continuing to optimize our margins by balancing products, revenue and cost considerations through better leveraging data and analytics to drive decision-making and accountability. The net result of these healthy revenue and cost metrics allowed us to get back to driving results. As we generated $1.9 billion in adjusted EBITDA in 2023, allowing us to generate the adjusted free cash flow to further strengthen our balance sheet with the repayment of nearly $2 billion in debt. On the product front, we are strategically enhancing the guest experience by identifying smart ROI-driven investments and decisions to profitably maximize guest satisfaction. Our recent success has been the rollout of Starlink high-speed Internet. We moved quickly and have been able to roll out this cutting-edge technology across half of our fleet since the spring of 2023 and expect to finish the full fleet by year-end this year. In addition, to significantly elevating the guest experience aboard our ships, we've been focusing on improving the pre-cruise guest experience and better leveraging digital tools across all three of our brands. For example, we've been making improvements to our pre-cruise planning functionality at Norwegian to allow guests to book even more before they leave their homes, and we rolled out a flexible air program at Oceania, sharing an innovation which began at Norwegian earlier in the year. This innovation gives guests the few day window to deviate their air at the beginning and end of their cruise so they can have more time to explore and enjoy destinations before and after they sail with us, while at the same time, allowing us to spread air demand over multiple days and save costs, a true win-win for us and our guests. On the digital side, we recently launched the Regent onboard mobile app on Seven Seas Grandeur, and we continue to see strong adoption of the NCL mobile app, which reached record-high guest usage in January. These improvements are not only resonating with our guests, giving them a better and more frictionless experience before, during, and after their cruise, but are also generating positive returns. Finally, we announced important interim sustainability commitments, announcing our target to reduce greenhouse gas intensity on a capacity day basis by 10% by 2026 and by 25% by 2030 versus 2019 levels. The company is truly firing on all cylinders. These solid operational and financial results have laid the foundation for a strong 2024 and position us to deliver sustained profitable growth in the future and incredible vacation experiences to the millions of guests who sail with us every year. In addition to these priorities, a key cornerstone of our long-term strategy is delivering measured capacity growth and optimizing our fleet to drive strong financial results. Our new build pipeline of five ships, which you can see on Slide 7, represents a capacity growth of 28% from 2023 to 2028 with a 5% CAGR over the period. Historically, capacity growth has led to outsized revenue and EBITDA growth, and we expect this capacity growth to be no different and deliver meaningful top- and bottom-line growth. We believe that these measured capacity additions will enable us to further enhance our long-term profitability and continue to significantly strengthen our balance sheet while providing guests new and innovative experiences. Shifting our discussion to the current booking environment shown on Slide 8. We continue to experience strong and resilient customer demand across all three of our brands. The strong momentum we saw in 2023 has continued into 2024 with an all-time high book position and pricing buoyed by strong wave season demand. This has led to some of the best booking weeks in the company history, which began with successful Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotions. In general, we continue to see healthy demand across all markets, brands, and products. Let me walk you through some recent trends. First, close-in demand for Caribbean sailing is particularly strong, prompting the redeployment of Norwegian Epic and Norwegian Getaway from offering shoulder season full 2024 voyages in the med to offering Caribbean sailings from Port Canaveral and New Orleans, respectively, beginning in October. As a result, our Caribbean capacity for the NCL brand is expected to increase by approximately 300 basis points in 2024 versus the prior year. Our industry's advantage lies in our ability to redeploy our ships and adapt to changes in consumer demand and preferences. These changes demonstrate our team's responsiveness to our guests' preferences. We have also seen demand return for sailings in Hawaii. While only accounting for approximately 4% of capacity in this period, these sailings are performing exceptionally well in 2024. Next, our Norwegian Cruise Line brand continues to see exceptionally strong demand, and our book position and pricing are higher than last year for all four quarters of 2024. Oceania and Regent also continued to see strong demand across all geographies with the exception of redeployed voyages due to cancellations in the Middle East and Red Sea. Turning to the Middle East. Last quarter, we made the pre-emptive decision to cancel all calls to Israel in 2024. And recently, we have announced the rerouting of our cruises sailing through the Red Sea for the rest of the year. As a reminder, just 1% and 4% of our capacity in Q1 and full year '24, respectively, was expected to visit the broader Middle East region. However, the Middle East represents a larger percentage of our capacity for our Oceania and Regent brands making up 12% and 8%, respectively. We now have no calls in the region in 2024, and all replacement cruises have been or are in the process of being put on sale. Overall, we are encouraged by the strength in our book position for 2024, which remains at all-time highs with commensurate higher pricing. As a result, 2024 is shaping up to be a solid year. We expect healthy full-year net yield growth of approximately 5.4% this year on a constant-currency basis, driven primarily by improved occupancy and pricing strength. Onboard revenue continues to be a bright spot with strength seen across the board, an encouraging indicator that our target consumer remains healthy and resilient. We are continuing to see strong demand for pre-cruise purchases which typically results in higher overall spend throughout a guest cruise journey. And while we have talked about our strong cost focus during 2023, we want to emphasize that this was not just a one-year exercise for our team. Rather, it is a cultural shift in the way our entire company looks at cost to ensure that we are operating as efficiently as possible while delivering experiences our guests truly value. This companywide focus should allow us to not only continue to reduce costs but, even more importantly, create operating leverage to enhance profitability, which will be foundational for our long-term success. Our recently established transformation office is allowing us to monitor and track these changes holding each area accountable for their initiatives. We believe this is apparent in our guidance where we expect our core cost to be flat in 2024 versus 2023. In conclusion, our strong top-line growth, combined with our continued focus on cost and margin enhancements, are expected to drive 2024 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS to grow by 18% and 76%, respectively, over last year. We are very excited about the future, and we plan to discuss our multiyear targets with the investment community in mid May. We look forward to meeting with you all then. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to walk you through our financial results and outlook. Mark? \n"

      "The first CEO Text from the dataset is: Thank you, Frank. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2018 and 2017 net yields and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day metrics on a constant currency basis. I'll begin with commentary on our third quarter results, followed by color on booking trends and will then discuss our guidance for fourth quarter and full year 2018, and close with a few items to consider as we look into 2019. Throughout my commentary, I will be referring to the slide presentation which Andrea mentioned earlier in the call. I am pleased to report yet another record quarter, one where the Company generated the highest quarterly revenue and earnings in its history. Slide four summarizes how our adjusted earnings per share of $2.27 exceeded expectations by $0.07, primarily driven by $0.02 of revenue outperformance from strong, well-priced, close-in bookings and exceptionally strong onboard revenue. A $0.02 benefit in fuel expense driven by better-than-expected fuel consumption efficiency from our newbuilds and benefits from continued energy savings initiatives, which were partially offset by higher fuel prices. And a $0.02 benefit resulting from the timing of certain ship operating costs, which have shifted into the fourth quarter, and the remainder comes from other below-the-line items. Turning to slide five. Net yield increased 4% or 3.9% on an as-reported basis versus prior year, outperforming guidance expectations by 50 basis points. The beat was driven by strong, well-priced close-in bookings and exceptionally strong onboard revenue across all major revenue streams. Excluding the benefit from our new Norwegian brand capacity, Norwegian Bliss, which garnered yields above the NCLH corporate average in the quarter, our third quarter net yield growth would have been approximately 2.25%, which excludes approximately 50 basis points of revenue dilution from China operations related to the itinerary optimization. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel, increased 2% versus prior year and 2.1% on an as-reported basis, slightly favorable to our guidance due to the timing of certain costs. Our total fuel expense was favorable versus expectations, as fuel consumption savings more than offset an increase in fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, which came in at $510. Now let's discuss capacity and deployment for the fourth quarter. Capacity is expected to increase approximately 7.7%, primarily due to the introduction of Norwegian Bliss into the fleet. Approximately 46% of our capacity is deployed in the Caribbean, in line with the prior year. Highlights for the region in the quarter include Norwegian Bliss, which is sailing her first winter season for Miami. Additionally, Norwegian Breakaway will homeport for the first time from New Orleans operating a Western Caribbean itinerary. She will be Norwegian's largest and newest ship to sail from the Belize (ph). And we are excited to bring this innovative Breakaway Class ship to this new homeport. Europe represents approximately 13% of our deployment, down slightly from prior year. As for other key markets, Asia, Africa Pacific accounts for approximately 13%, Hawaii 4% with the remaining balance of our deployment comprised of repositioning cruises, South America sailings, as well as Panama Canal and Mexican Riviera voyages. Our expectations for the fourth quarter can be found on slide six. Net yield is expected to increase approximately 4% or 3.7% on an as-reported basis. This growth comes despite headwinds from the higher-than-expected revenue impact from China sailings related to the itinerary optimizations discussed on our last call. Excluding the benefit from our new Norwegian brand capacity, Norwegian Bliss, which is garnering yields above the NCLH corporate average, while sailing in the Caribbean, net yield growth is expected to be approximately 4.25%, which excludes approximately 75 basis points of revenue dilution from China operations. Turning to costs. Adjusted net net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately 1.5% or 1.75% on an as-reported basis, primarily due to additional marketing investments to support the new itineraries launch as part of the aforementioned itinerary optimization and to drive 2019 and 2020 bookings, all of which will be funded by a one-time benefit as a result of certain tax planning initiatives. An increase in the accrual of performance-related compensation due to higher confidence that certain annual performance targets will be achieved at year-end and the timing of certain expenses between the third and fourth quarters. Looking at fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, to be $484, with expected consumption of approximately 215,000 metric tons. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $0.78, a 15% increase over prior year. Slide seven outlines our latest guidance for the full year. Adjusted net yield is expected to increase approximately 3.3% or 3.6% on an as-reported basis, which represents a 130 basis point increase versus our initial 2018 guidance provided in February. Excluding new tonnage introduced for the Norwegian brand, net yield is expected to be up 3.8%, which excludes approximately 30 basis points of revenue dilution from China operations. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel, is expected to be up 2% or 2.5% on an as-reported basis. The increase versus prior guidance is attributed to the aforementioned sales and marketing investments, and increased performance incentive compensation. Looking at fuel expense. Our fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, is expected to be $480 with expected consumption of approximately 817,000 metric tons. Fuel consumption favorability is being offset by higher fuel prices for the remainder of the year. As a result of these revised expectations, our improved adjusted EPS outlook of approximately $4.85 once again surpasses the high-end of our previous guidance range and represents a 22.5% growth, which comes on top of the prior year's strong growth of 16%. Slide eight walks through the components of the $0.10 raise in our adjusted EPS guidance. $0.04 is attributable to the revenue outperformance, half of which comes from the third quarter and the other half from operational performance in the fourth quarter, partially offset by approximately $0.02 from incremental revenue dilution from China operations; a $0.04 benefit from lower depreciation and amortization; a $0.05 benefit as a result of tax planning initiatives, which is fully offsetting the $0.05 increase in certain net cruise costs; and the remaining benefit is due to a slight improvement for our outlook in interest expense and other below-the-line items. Our margins continue to expand in 2018, with further expansion expected in 2019 and beyond, as we leverage our growth profile to drive topline results, while our razor-sharp focus on controllable costs is complemented by the scale benefit we will enjoy from the launch of new ships into our fleet. As for the balance sheet, it continues to strengthen and we expect to be approximately 3.3 times levered at the end of 2018. And are on track to reach our targeted leverage range of 2.5 to 2.75 times by the end of 2020. In addition, we are also on track to deliver on our 2020 adjusted EPS CAGR, adjusted ROIC and shareholder return targets we provided at Investor Day, which are illustrated on slide nine. This comes despite headwinds from rising fuel prices and fluctuating foreign exchange rates. Now I'd like to provide some context on 2019 expectations. The year is shaping up extremely well as the robust booking environment for cruise vacations remains healthy, bolstered by our successful demand generation initiatives, resulting in strong demand across our three brands. And while we expect 2019 earnings growth in the single-digit range for a multitude of reasons, the core fundamentals of our business are strong and fully intact. Next year's earnings growth is a reflection of the timing of our newbuild deliveries, coupled with our investment in the strategic itinerary optimization initiative, which are both expected to benefit future period results and bolster shareholder returns in 2020 and beyond. And let's not forget, 2019 is lapping extraordinary financial results with 2018 earnings growth of 22.5%. Now, let's walk through a few items to keep in mind as we move into next year. First, as previously discussed, our strategic itinerary optimization initiative is expected to drive strong organic net yield growth, primarily as a result of Norwegian Joy's redeployment. However, at the same time, one-time cost related to the initiative, including a non-cash write-off of approximately $25 million are expected to mostly offset the incremental revenue and related contribution generated in 2019. Both our net yield and our net cruise cost metrics will increase, resulting in only a slight accretion to adjusted earnings per share for the year. In 2020 and beyond, we expect to realize the full earnings power from the strategic initiative with accretion to adjusted EPS expected to be approximately $0.30. Second, the first quarter is expected to be the lowest yield growth quarter as a result of the shift of the Easter holiday into the second quarter of 2019, as well as Joy's final China sailings during the low season. Third, our incremental marketing costs associated with the new deployments of the vessels involved in the optimization initiative, as well as launch and inaugural expenses for Norwegian Encore and Seven Seas Splendor as they do not enter the fleet until November 2019 and January 2020, respectively. Concurrently, higher fuel pricing is expected to drive fuel cost, net of hedges, approximately 10% higher versus 2018 expectations. Lastly, there are nine scheduled dry-docks for the year, including six of the 10 ships and the combined high-yielding Oceania and Regent fleet. Turning back to the fuel environment. As the 2020 IMO regulations approach, we strategically layered on additional MGO hedges for both 2019 and 2020 to mitigate our exposure to the markets. As a result, we currently have 55% and 49% of our total fuel consumption hedge in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Also, in an effort to improve the future correlation between our hedge proxy and the price we pay at the pump, we switched our proxy for hedging MGO from Brent to Gasoil. As a refined distillate product similar to MGO, Gasoil is expected to better protect against the risk of increased pricing spreads as opposed to Brent. As we look beyond 2020, we expect to equip our two Breakaway Class ships with exhaust gas cleaning systems, which will further insulate us from higher fuel prices starting in 2021. As a reminder, all of our installations are closed-loop systems, which is a higher standard than that of current regulations. To recap, as you can see on slide 10, we've delivered another record quarter with the highest revenue and earnings in our Company's history. We have once again increased our full-year outlook above the high end of previous guidance. We have strong conviction in our 2019 outlook and are well positioned to achieve our 2020 targets and provide further shareholder returns. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank for closing commentary. \n"

      "The first CEO Text from the dataset is: Well, thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported our full year and December quarter results, posting fourth quarter earnings of $1.1 billion, or $1.28 per share, on record quarterly revenue that was 11% higher than 2022 and an operating margin of 10%. I want to sincerely thank the 100,000-strong Delta team for their outstanding work in delivering these results and serving our customers. Delta carried more travelers this holiday season than any other time in our history, and we delivered industry-leading operational performance, with the No. 1 system completion factor among our peer set throughout the December quarter. To put that in context, we carried 9 million customers, a record 9 million customers, I'd add, on 60,000 mainline flights over the holiday period, with fewer than 40 cancellations in aggregate. Our December quarter results marked a strong close to Year 2 of our three-year plan. For the full year, we reported earnings of $6.25 per share, the second-highest EPS result in our history, on revenue that was 20% higher than the prior year. We delivered an 11.6% operating margin and pre-tax income of $5.2 billion, a near-doubling over 2022. We generated free cash flow of $2 billion while investing 5.3 billion back into the business, and we improved our leverage by two full turns and reinstated our quarterly dividend. Return on invested capital was 13.4%, a 5-point improvement from 2022. A tremendous amount of progress, especially if you consider where we sat a short three years ago, and I'm so proud of our team across the board. Sharing our financial success is a long-standing pillar of Delta's culture, and I'm thrilled to announce that we'll be rewarding our employees with $1.4 billion in well-earned profit-sharing on Valentine's Day. For our employees, the estimated payout will be approximately 10% of eligible 2023 compensation, about double of what last year's payment was. I expect our profit-sharing payments will be more than our three largest competitors combined. Our people consistently deliver operational excellence, with a relentless focus on raising the bar at every stage of the travel journey to deliver safe, reliable, and caring service for our customers. They are the reason our brand and our customer loyalty lead the industry, why Delta was recognized as the world's 12th most admired company by Fortune, and why Glassdoor named us yesterday as the 13th best employer in the country. In 2023, we made meaningful investments in our people, our operation, and our customers. We provided well-deserved pay increases for the Delta team, continuing our philosophy of industry-leading pay for industry-leading performance. In the operation, the investments that we made supported the best-in-class operational performance that Delta has long been known for. Our operational excellence was recognized by Cirium last week, which named us yet again the most on-time airline in North America. Our people and our operational reliability are the foundation of Delta's trusted consumer brand, and we are building on that foundation as we elevate the premium flying experience and grow our SkyMiles members' engagement with Delta. Today, we also announced an order for 20 Airbus 350-1000 aircraft, with options for 20 more, for delivery starting in 2026. These planes complement our fleet strategy and will offer a world-class customer experience for international travelers with more premium seats, higher gauge, and great customer amenities. These aircraft are over 20% more fuel efficient than the 767s that they'll be replacing, further supporting our long-term sustainability goals. And with the successful launch of fast, free Wi-Fi and Delta Sync, we are enhancing the inflight entertainment experience for SkyMiles members. We expect to have these products rolled out globally by the end of this year. On the ground, we are building the airports of the future in some of the most important markets and adding new Delta Sky Clubs to provide our customers a world-class airport experience. We completed our transformation at Los Angeles 18 months ahead of schedule, including a state-of-the-art facility and a new Delta Sky Club that was named North America's Best Airline Lounge for 2023 by Business Traveler. We opened the latest phase of our Salt Lake City expansion, and we'll complete the generational rebuild of LaGuardia this year. Our digital investments continue as we work to increase our agility and provide employees with better tools and customers with a more seamless experience. Customers visited the Fly Delta App over 1 billion times last year, using our self-service tools almost 10 times more often than 2019, with much higher overall satisfaction. As 2024 begins, our enterprise has moved from a period of restoration to optimization. We are focused on delivering excellent reliability, elevating the customer experience, and improving efficiency across the company to support continued growth in our earnings and our cash flow. We expect demand to remain strong, particularly for the premium experiences that Delta provides. Consumer spend is continuing to shift from goods to services, and our customer base is in a healthy financial position, with travel remaining a top priority. And corporate travel continues to improve, with demand accelerating into year-end. On supply, industry growth is normalizing after several years of network restoration. For 2024, we plan to grow Delta's capacity 3% to 5%, below the mid-single digit range that we discussed at our June Investor Day as we've refined our plan. Domestically, supply and demand are coming into better balance as the industry adjusts to rising cost of production and we are seeing a positive inflection in domestic unit revenue growth. Internationally, we expect another strong year as we optimize our network and leverage our global JV partners. With that backdrop, we are providing full year 2024 guidance for earnings of $6 to $7 per share, excuse me, and free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion. Free cash guidance is up to $2 billion higher than 2023, driven by growth and profitability, lower capex, and improved mix of cash sales. As we continue to grow earnings and reduce debt, we will further reduce leverage and advance our balance sheet toward investment-grade metrics. Glen and Dan will provide more details shortly, including our outlook for the March quarter. In closing, the people of Delta delivered a remarkable 2023, leading the industry operationally and financially while providing a world-class experience for our customers. Delta is well-positioned to build on our momentum in the new year, with continued growth in earnings and cash flow in 2024. I could not be more excited about what's ahead for Delta and our customers, and I am confident that our returns-focused strategy will drive significant value creation for our owners in the years to come. Thank you again for the support you show to our company. And with that, I'll turn it over to Glen. \n"

      "The first CEO Text from the dataset is: Thanks, Glen. Good morning everyone, and thank you again for joining us this morning. Our results through the first half of the year show that we are delivering against our Investor Day plan to drive both top-line growth, margin expansion and continue to return consistently to our owners. In the first half of the year, revenue was grown by 8%, our operating margins have expanded by 200 basis points and we've grown earnings per share by 30%. We've also generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow more than all of 2018, with $2 billion of that going back to shareholders. Our after-tax ROIC on a trailing 12-month basis is 15.3%, as the investments we have made are driving strong returns. These results give us confidence to raise full-year revenue, earnings per share and free cash flow guidance. For the full year, we are on track to deliver 6% to 7% top-line growth, at least 150 basis points of margin expansion and 25% EPS growth. With the results to date and updated expectations for the full year, we now expect to return $3 billion to shareholders in 2019. This is a $500 million increase above our initial plan outlined at Investor Day. Turning to June quarter results, we set a June quarter record with pre-tax income of $2 billion. Our operating margin of 17.1% with 2.3 points higher than last year, our pre-tax margin of 16% was the highest we have achieved in two years. We are firmly on track to exceed our target for full-year margin expansion and now expect at least 150 basis points of improvement versus 2018. We continue to deliver solid cost performance with efficiency gains throughout our operations. Fleet transformation and One Delta initiatives all contributing. For the June quarter, non-fuel unit costs were up 1.4% in line with our guidance of 1% to 2%. This included approximately $60 million of pressure due to higher depreciation expense associated with our decision to accelerate the retirement of the MD-90 fleet by two years to the end of 2022. This impact is largely limited to the June quarter as 31 aircraft were permanently retired. We will retire another nine of these aircraft by year-end and expect MD-90 depreciation to moderate in future periods. One Delta is enabling a more efficient approach to our ongoing fleet transformation as well. The team has identified a number of opportunities to drive incremental efficiency gains, as we transition aircraft into and out of the fleet, minimizing friction costs from operating small sub fleets. We will continue to realize fleet simplification benefits as we reduce and exit another fleet type in the MD-90. And as we induct new aircraft such as the A330-900neo, we are streamlining entry into service to minimize unproductive time. This enables crew efficiencies through better training and scheduling management and drives incrementally higher ROIC through less idle time on the asset. Non-fuel unit costs increased 0.6% in the first half of the year, giving us confidence in our full year CASM-Ex guide of approximately 1%. In the back half of 2019, we face tougher cost comparisons from last year's performance, as well as decelerating capacity growth. While fuel was volatile during the June quarter, Brent prices remain below prior year levels. Total fuel expense decreased $35 million on 4% lower market fuel prices. Refinery profits of roughly $40 million were flat to last year. Our refleeting and One Delta initiatives drove a 1.6% improvement in fuel efficiency in the June quarter, and we expect 2% fuel efficiency gain for the full year. Non-operating expenses for the quarter were $60 million higher than prior year due to lower pension income and a decline in our equity partner earnings. For the full year, we now expect non-operating expense to be in the range of $525 million to $575 million. This is above prior expectations due primarily to these lower partner earnings. For the September quarter, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.10 to $2.40 per share, up 25% versus prior year at the midpoint. This equates to a pre-tax margin of 14.5% to 16.5% comparing favorably to last year's 13.6% result. This includes an expectation for non-fuel unit cost growth of 1% to 2% and all-in fuel price of $1.95 to $2.15 per gallon. This is down from last year and similar to the June quarter. Our guidance includes an approximately $40 million contribution from the refinery this quarter, which is expected to benefit the September quarter fuel price per gallon by roughly $0.04. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong, adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR of 1.7 times is at the low end of our target leverage ratio of 1.5 to 2.5 times. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continue to proactively address our pension obligation with a voluntary $500 million contribution in the June quarter. We generated $3.3 billion of operating cash flow and reinvested $1.4 billion into the business during the June quarter. This produced free cash flow of $1.8 billion, bringing our first half free cash flow to $2.5 billion. This represented conversion of more than 100% of net income, nicely ahead of last year benefited by both top-line growth and margin expansion. Our strong first half performance sets us up to achieve $4 billion in free cash flow for the full year and we expect net income conversion of nearly 90%. This includes our expectation for full-year CapEx of $4.5 billion, which is unchanged from initial guidance provided in Investor Day. Our healthy balance sheet and cash generation enable us to consistently return cash back to our owners, while also investing in the future growth of the company. During the quarter, we returned $497 million to shareholders, including the accelerated buyback earlier this year, total shareholder returns are just over $2 billion through the first six months of the year. We funded our accelerated buyback in the first quarter with $1 billion short-term loan, with cash flow running ahead of plan, we completed repayment of the short-term facility earlier than anticipated. Since first announcing our capital allocation strategy in 2013, we have returned more than $14 billion to owners. We have reduced our fully diluted share count by approximately 25% and increased our dividend for six consecutive years. But importantly, we have done that while also investing in our business and our people. Additionally, we are maintaining low debt levels and improving the funded status of our pension plans, as part of our commitment to maintain our investment grade credit ratings. Our consistent repurchase activity in 15% dividend increase in the third quarter demonstrate our continued strong conviction on the durability and sustainability of our business model. These results are a validation of our unrivaled network, our dedicated people and our powerful brand. Our competitive advantages continue to deliver industry-leading results and drive long-term value for all of our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jill to begin the Q&A. \n"

      "The first CEO Text from the dataset is: Thank you, Julie, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. As we close the books on 2023, I want to take a moment to reflect on how far we've come. And more importantly, I want to thank the people at Southwest Airlines for their dedication, their warrior spirit, their heart, and ultimately, for their incredible resilience. At this time last year, we were getting back on our feet from the disruption following Winter Storm Elliott. We quickly mobilized to put immediate mitigation efforts in place while simultaneously building a robust plan to prepare us for future extreme winter weather disruptions. We were also working to restore our network, address our staffing needs, and return our aircraft to full utilization. And of course, we were in the middle of negotiations with the majority of our labor unions. I'm incredibly pleased to be on the other side of 2023 and to be able to share all the progress we made last year. We completed a comprehensive winter weather action plan, which has already been successfully tested in multiple weather -- winter weather events, including the types of disruptions, such as hurricanes, severe fog in Chicago, and the Maui fires. Through all of those events, our aircraft and crew networks remained stable. We recovered quickly, and we were able to minimize the impact on our customers. We also got fully staffed, restored our network, and reached full utilization of our fleet. Our network is in a healthy place, and it shows in our operational improvement. In fact, we improved in nearly every operational metric. Our completion factor performance, in particular, was fantastic at 99% for the full year with fourth quarter being our best quarterly performance in more than a decade at 99.6%. We also made significant progress on our labor agreements, including the ratification earlier this week of an agreement that secures industry-leading pay for our best-in-class pilots. We have now successfully reached ratification on providing competitive market compensation packages for our people. This is a huge accomplishment, and I would like to thank all those who have tirelessly supported those negotiations. Of course, all of this was in addition to a host of other accomplishments: the rollout of a new revenue management system, the launch of multiple customer experience improvements, and the negotiation of a very cost-effective order book with Boeing. The order book allows us to continue the modernization of our fleet and provides the opportunity to flex our growth plans up or down over the long term. We also made rapid adjustments to capacity for both 2023 and 2024 and put in place significant network adjustments in response to changing demand patterns. These changes reduced our planned 2024 year-over-year capacity increase to roughly 6%, all of which is carryover from 2023 network restoration. So there will be no net new additional capacity in in 2024 as we work to mature our route network. Moving to our performance, we continue to be very pleased with the core demand for our product. We saw close-in performance strengthened in November and December for both leisure and corporate travel. This led fourth quarter 2023 to be yet another record at just over $6.8 billion in operating revenue, and we are seeing that strength continue into 2024. This demand strength, combined with about $1.5 billion in incremental year-over-year pre-tax profit from our network optimization efforts and the contributions from our portfolio of strategic initiatives is driving us to expect additional revenue records and year-over-year operating margin expansion despite cost pressures from new labor agreements and increased aircraft maintenance expense. Our network changes are materially in place with the March schedule where we expect to hit a profitability inflection point. While still early in the quarter, our initiatives are delivering toward our revenue target, and we expect to exit the quarter with a strong operating margin for the month of March. While we have significant inflationary pressures from our new labor agreements, we have initiatives underway that will begin to help counter these pressures from scheduling techniques to digital modernization, and we plan to end 2024 with headcount flat to down as compared with year-end 2023 as we slow hiring to levels that are at or below our attrition rate that will drive efficiency gains in 2024 with more to come in 2025. All of this supports a solid plan with a line of sight to improve our financial returns and earn our cost of capital in 2024. While this represents notable progress, I want to be clear, earning adequate and consistent returns ROIC well in excess of WACC is our financial North Star, and it's not negotiable. We will be relentless in executing against our plans, and we will continue to make adjustments, including capacity adjustments, if needed, until we deliver those results. Adequate and consistent returns is how we have created decades of shareholder value, and it continues to be our key focus. Our current set of initiatives is tracking nicely, and we will provide you a lot more detail later this year at investor day. In addition, we're working on a next set of initiatives to support and support sustainable returns over time. In closing, we made tremendous progress in 2023, and we finished the year a much stronger company. We will finish this year stronger again. We are fully committed to improving the customer experience and delivering on our long-term financial targets, including generating returns for our shareholders. As always, I have confidence in our people and our business model, and I am particularly proud of our people for their dedication and their resilience. They remain our absolute greatest asset, the heart and soul of our company, and the ultimate source of pride for me. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. \n"

      "The first CEO Text from the dataset is: Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Moving right into cost. Our third quarter CASM, excluding special items, increased 4.1% year-over-year, driven in part by a nearly 9% increase in our hedged fuel costs. Our hedged fuel price per gallon remains steady at $2.25, and that's despite an increase in market jet fuel prices during the quarter. Our hedged jet fuel remains in line with our guidance due to more material hedging gains that kicked in at higher prices. The $0.04 net hedge benefit consisted of $0.10 of hedging gains offset by $0.06 of premium costs. For fourth quarter and based on market prices last Friday and given our hedging positions, we expect our fuel price per gallon to be in the $2.30 to $2.35 range. This guidance includes an estimated $0.07 net hedging benefit, including $0.14 of hedging gains, offset by $0.07 of premium costs. The $0.10 sequential increase in our estimated fourth quarter fuel price normalizing for the hedging gain is largely due to the increase in market prices. For 2019, we are also well prepared with a 63% hedge in protection beginning at $70 Brent crude equivalent with more material gains that kick in at $80 per barrel and continue to increase well above $100 per barrel. Our 2019 hedges are a mix of WTI and Brent crude oil and are structured so that we fully participate in market price decline. For full year 2019, based on market prices last Friday and our current hedging positions, we expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be in the $2.35 to $2.40 range, with an estimated $0.08 hedging gain and $0.04 premium cost. We expect 2019 fuel hedge premium costs which is included in fuel and oil expense to be approximately $80 million or $0.04 per gallon and down from this year. As Mike said, we continue to benefit from increased fuel efficiency from our fleet modernization. Our third quarter available seat mile per gallon, which is our key fuel efficiency metric, improved by 1.1% year-over-year. As I mentioned last quarter, our fuel efficiency improvement is slightly behind our 2018 goal of 2% to 3%, primarily due to our utilization of the -700 fleet to cover our fleet deficit and suboptimal flight schedule. As our schedule becomes more optimized and as we take on more MAX aircraft and began the retirement cycle of the 700, we expect the fuel efficiency profile of our fleet to continue to improve. In fact, I expect sequential improvement in our fourth quarter year-over-year fuel efficiency more in line with what we were expecting for the full year. I'm going to move on to third and fourth quarter non-fuel costs, and I'll talk in more detail about 2019 at the end of my prepared remarks. When you strip out fuel profit sharing and special items, our unit cost at inflation in third quarter was in line with our expectations. As we previously disclosed in our investor update, our third quarter unit costs were impacted by weather-related flight cancellations, resulting in about 1 point reduction in ASM. When combined with modest weather-related costs, the flight cancellations resulted in a nearly 1 point year-over-year negative impact to CASM. We ended up at the lower end of our CASM guidance, primarily due to approximately $10 million of spending that shifted into the fourth quarter and beyond. The shifts are primarily due to the timing of maintenance events and technology spending. Aside from shifting, the other cost categories were pretty much in line with expectations. Our fourth quarter year-over-year CASM outlook looks good, particularly from the easier comparisons that we had with last year's tax reform year-end bonus. Despite some cost pressure from shifting of spend out of the first half and third quarter, fourth quarter year-over-year CASM, excluding fuel special items and profit sharing is expected to be flat to up 1%. We've also had some capacity cuts here in fourth quarter, so we do have some related cost pressures. Netting out the moving parts, our full year 2018 CASM, excluding fuel profit sharing and special items remains unchanged. Our balance sheet remains very strong and investment-grade credit rating and with ample liquidity and we also have very healthy cash flows. Our year-to-date operating cash flow was $3.9 billion. We've invested $1.4 billion back into the business thus far in 2018. And for full year 2018 CapEx, we continue to expect to be in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion range and we are planning for a similar level of CapEx for 2019. So far, in 2018, we've returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through $1.5 billion in share repurchases and $332 million in dividends. This includes the $500 million accelerated share repurchase we launched in the third quarter and just completed earlier this month. This most recent ASR completed our previous $2 billion share repurchase authorization and the first $150 million from our new $2 billion authorization. So we have $1.85 billion remaining. Over the past five years, we've returned nearly all of our free cash flow through share repurchases and dividends, supporting our commitment to returning significant value to our shareholders. So overall, I'm very pleased with our continued approach to capital deployment with appropriate balance. We intend to continue investing back in the business while focusing on opportunities to drive further value, and we continue to have great opportunities to do so in particular with further investments in fleet modernization. Barring unforeseen circumstances, we also intend to continually return value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends with our excess cash. Regarding our fleet plan, we made some slight tweaks to our order book recently. First as planned, we took delivery of five Boeing 737-800 aircraft and seven MAX 8s in the quarter and we continue to expect to end the year with 751 aircraft. During third quarter, we signed leases on an additional four MAX 8 aircraft with delivery in 2019. We still have 27 firm orders with Boeing for 737 MAX 7 and MAX 8 aircraft next year, and now we have seven leased MAX 8s coming next year as well for a total of 34 aircraft in 2019. As we've previously shared, we're planning to designate some of our 737-700 aircraft for retirement next year to support our continued investment in fleet modernization. These additional aircraft acquisitions or any future opportunities to pick up a few additional new aircraft for fleet replacement do not change our previously communicated 2019 capacity plan. On the capacity side, with the storm cancellations in the third quarter, we are now planning for our 2018 capacity to increase approximately 4% with fourth quarter ASMs up in the 6% to 6.5% range year-over-year. And we continue to plan for 2019 capacity to increase no more than 5% year-over-year, which is unchanged. Our schedule is currently published through early June 2019, and they exclude expected Hawaii flying. You can see that excluding Hawaii, our January through May year-over-year ASM growth is modest. In regards to 2019 cost, and as Gary mentioned, we are expecting full year 2019 CASM excluding fuel and profit sharing to increase at least 3% year-over-year. The key drivers of our year-over-year unit cost pressures in 2019 are primarily due to operation, staffing demand and healthcare inflation, which is driving an increase in salary, wages and benefits. Increased maintenance expense, driven in part by expected timing of maintenance events. Airport cost increase is driven in part by airport infrastructure investments and continued heavy investments in technology focused primarily on operational investments. Much of the cost inflation we are seeing here in the second half 2018 is continuing into next year. Of course, I'm adjusting our current fourth quarter 2018 unit cost trends for higher fourth quarter capacity growth, as well as fourth quarter 2017's tax reform employee bonus and charitable contribution, which was about 3 points to fourth quarter 2017. So our current growth rate continues into next year and we will shift our number one focus to control cost in 2019 to arrest that trend. In closing, we had an excellent third quarter and we were able to expand our net margin and deliver record third quarter earnings per share. These are notable achievements in the industry and I'd like to thank our more than 58,000 employees for their outstanding efforts. I'm very pleased with our rebound in revenue trends in third quarter and our continued momentum thus far in fourth quarter. Our fuel hedging gains have offset a significant portion of higher market jet fuel prices so far this year and we'll continue to provide protection, especially if prices continue to rise. While we face some unit cost inflation next year, I believe we have great opportunities ahead of us to more efficiently scale our growth and drive further productivity and efficiencies and this will be a primary focus for us next year. We strive to continue delivering very healthy margins as we continue to invest in our future. We continue to deliver high returns on invested capital and that will remain a top priority. With that Abby, we are ready to take questions. \n"
