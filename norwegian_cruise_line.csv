Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 27, 2024","Well, thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. I want to welcome everyone to our fourth-quarter earnings call. It's such a great time to be in the cruise industry with wonderful new products available across all three of our award-winning brands. The demand for cruise vacations is certainly as robust as we have ever seen it. And the continued innovation on board is leading to outstanding financial performance and exceptional guest satisfaction scores and guest repeat rates. Today, it's my pleasure to discuss some of our key milestones in 2023, our progress on our near-term priorities, recent booking trends, and our outlook for 2024. Later in the call, I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide more color on our 2023 performance and guidance for 2024. Now, 2023 can best be described as a landmark year for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. We started the year on the heels of the last of the impact from COVID and the last of the cruise ports reopening in the Asia Pacific region throughout Q1. But as you can see on Slide 5, consumer demand was quick to rebound in full, and we were pleased to return to full ships and full year profitability. It is so incredibly rewarding for our staff and crew to be able to operate full ships and deliver vacation experiences of a lifetime to our happy guests. While that in and of itself would have made for a spectacular 2023, we were further going by the introduction of three new world-class ships into our fleet, one for each of our three award-winning brands. This was an unprecedented achievement and a first in the 57-year history of our company. We welcomed Oceania Cruises Vista in May, Norwegian Viva in August, and most recently, the highly anticipated Regent Seven Seas Grandeur in November. The successful launch of three vessels in one year would not have been possible without the hard work and unwavering commitment of crew and team members across the globe. Thanks to their dedication and passion for providing an unmatched guest experience, the reception for these new ships continues to be overwhelmingly positive across the board. This reception, combined with the strong demand environment we continue to experience across all three of our brands, has enabled us to successfully absorb an 18% increase in capacity in 2023 versus 2019 levels at record pricing levels. As a result, we have driven revenue per passenger cruise day up 17%, allowing us to finish the year with year-end advanced ticket sales of $3.2 billion, up an incredible 56% compared to 2019. At the same time, we continue to maximize onboard revenue generation, as shown by growth onboard revenue per passenger cruise day, which is up 27% over 2019. A main driver of this large improvement is through enhanced presold onboard revenue, so our guests come on board with a fresh wallet. But none of this is new news. As we have been and continue to be the industry leader in net yields, we are proud of the work our teams do day in and day out to drive the highest yields in the industry. But today, I also want to emphasize that we are equally passionate about the cost side of the business. Our relentless focus on cost optimization has produced four sequential quarters of year-over-year adjusted new -- of year-over-year adjusted net cruise cost per capacity day reduction with full year 2023 coming in 21% lower than the prior year. We achieved this by focusing our efforts on optimizing spend and investments across all areas of the business, from fuel to food and consumables and marketing. We are committed to continuing to optimize our margins by balancing products, revenue and cost considerations through better leveraging data and analytics to drive decision-making and accountability. The net result of these healthy revenue and cost metrics allowed us to get back to driving results. As we generated $1.9 billion in adjusted EBITDA in 2023, allowing us to generate the adjusted free cash flow to further strengthen our balance sheet with the repayment of nearly $2 billion in debt. On the product front, we are strategically enhancing the guest experience by identifying smart ROI-driven investments and decisions to profitably maximize guest satisfaction. Our recent success has been the rollout of Starlink high-speed Internet. We moved quickly and have been able to roll out this cutting-edge technology across half of our fleet since the spring of 2023 and expect to finish the full fleet by year-end this year. In addition, to significantly elevating the guest experience aboard our ships, we've been focusing on improving the pre-cruise guest experience and better leveraging digital tools across all three of our brands. For example, we've been making improvements to our pre-cruise planning functionality at Norwegian to allow guests to book even more before they leave their homes, and we rolled out a flexible air program at Oceania, sharing an innovation which began at Norwegian earlier in the year. This innovation gives guests the few day window to deviate their air at the beginning and end of their cruise so they can have more time to explore and enjoy destinations before and after they sail with us, while at the same time, allowing us to spread air demand over multiple days and save costs, a true win-win for us and our guests. On the digital side, we recently launched the Regent onboard mobile app on Seven Seas Grandeur, and we continue to see strong adoption of the NCL mobile app, which reached record-high guest usage in January. These improvements are not only resonating with our guests, giving them a better and more frictionless experience before, during, and after their cruise, but are also generating positive returns. Finally, we announced important interim sustainability commitments, announcing our target to reduce greenhouse gas intensity on a capacity day basis by 10% by 2026 and by 25% by 2030 versus 2019 levels. The company is truly firing on all cylinders. These solid operational and financial results have laid the foundation for a strong 2024 and position us to deliver sustained profitable growth in the future and incredible vacation experiences to the millions of guests who sail with us every year. In addition to these priorities, a key cornerstone of our long-term strategy is delivering measured capacity growth and optimizing our fleet to drive strong financial results. Our new build pipeline of five ships, which you can see on Slide 7, represents a capacity growth of 28% from 2023 to 2028 with a 5% CAGR over the period. Historically, capacity growth has led to outsized revenue and EBITDA growth, and we expect this capacity growth to be no different and deliver meaningful top- and bottom-line growth. We believe that these measured capacity additions will enable us to further enhance our long-term profitability and continue to significantly strengthen our balance sheet while providing guests new and innovative experiences. Shifting our discussion to the current booking environment shown on Slide 8. We continue to experience strong and resilient customer demand across all three of our brands. The strong momentum we saw in 2023 has continued into 2024 with an all-time high book position and pricing buoyed by strong wave season demand. This has led to some of the best booking weeks in the company history, which began with successful Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotions. In general, we continue to see healthy demand across all markets, brands, and products. Let me walk you through some recent trends. First, close-in demand for Caribbean sailing is particularly strong, prompting the redeployment of Norwegian Epic and Norwegian Getaway from offering shoulder season full 2024 voyages in the med to offering Caribbean sailings from Port Canaveral and New Orleans, respectively, beginning in October. As a result, our Caribbean capacity for the NCL brand is expected to increase by approximately 300 basis points in 2024 versus the prior year. Our industry's advantage lies in our ability to redeploy our ships and adapt to changes in consumer demand and preferences. These changes demonstrate our team's responsiveness to our guests' preferences. We have also seen demand return for sailings in Hawaii. While only accounting for approximately 4% of capacity in this period, these sailings are performing exceptionally well in 2024. Next, our Norwegian Cruise Line brand continues to see exceptionally strong demand, and our book position and pricing are higher than last year for all four quarters of 2024. Oceania and Regent also continued to see strong demand across all geographies with the exception of redeployed voyages due to cancellations in the Middle East and Red Sea. Turning to the Middle East. Last quarter, we made the pre-emptive decision to cancel all calls to Israel in 2024. And recently, we have announced the rerouting of our cruises sailing through the Red Sea for the rest of the year. As a reminder, just 1% and 4% of our capacity in Q1 and full year '24, respectively, was expected to visit the broader Middle East region. However, the Middle East represents a larger percentage of our capacity for our Oceania and Regent brands making up 12% and 8%, respectively. We now have no calls in the region in 2024, and all replacement cruises have been or are in the process of being put on sale. Overall, we are encouraged by the strength in our book position for 2024, which remains at all-time highs with commensurate higher pricing. As a result, 2024 is shaping up to be a solid year. We expect healthy full-year net yield growth of approximately 5.4% this year on a constant-currency basis, driven primarily by improved occupancy and pricing strength. Onboard revenue continues to be a bright spot with strength seen across the board, an encouraging indicator that our target consumer remains healthy and resilient. We are continuing to see strong demand for pre-cruise purchases which typically results in higher overall spend throughout a guest cruise journey. And while we have talked about our strong cost focus during 2023, we want to emphasize that this was not just a one-year exercise for our team. Rather, it is a cultural shift in the way our entire company looks at cost to ensure that we are operating as efficiently as possible while delivering experiences our guests truly value. This companywide focus should allow us to not only continue to reduce costs but, even more importantly, create operating leverage to enhance profitability, which will be foundational for our long-term success. Our recently established transformation office is allowing us to monitor and track these changes holding each area accountable for their initiatives. We believe this is apparent in our guidance where we expect our core cost to be flat in 2024 versus 2023. In conclusion, our strong top-line growth, combined with our continued focus on cost and margin enhancements, are expected to drive 2024 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS to grow by 18% and 76%, respectively, over last year. We are very excited about the future, and we plan to discuss our multiyear targets with the investment community in mid May. We look forward to meeting with you all then. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to walk you through our financial results and outlook. Mark? ","Thank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our fourth-quarter 2023 financial results, 2024 guidance, and our financial position. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on 2023 and 2024 net per diem, net yield, and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics, are on a constant-currency basis, and comparisons are to the same period in 2019 and 2023, respectively. Let's begin with our fourth-quarter results, which are highlighted on Slide 11. Starting with the top line, results were strong with net per diems increasing approximately 14.5% and net yield increasing approximately 8.6%. As discussed last quarter, several factors contributed to the exceptionally strong growth we saw, including the favorable comp from the rapid exit of Cuba in 2019 as well as a very strong close-in demand for Caribbean sailings. Looking at costs, adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day was in line with guidance at $151 in the quarter marking our fourth consecutive quarter of improvement on this important metric. As expected, this included approximately $1 of certain nonrecurring net benefits realized in the quarter. We have made significant progress streamlining our cost base during 2023, demonstrating our focus and commitment to our margin enhancement initiatives, and expect to continue this focus in 2024 and beyond. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $360 million, in line with guidance, while adjusted EPS was a loss of negative $0.18 slightly below guidance due to a $0.06 impact from FX below the line. Overall, we were very pleased with the results we generated in the fourth quarter and full year. Strong top-line growth, combined with continued progress on reducing costs, enabled us to generate full-year adjusted EBITDA just short of $1.9 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.70. All of which drove strong adjusted free cash flow of $1.1 billion. I am confident that our improved financial performance in 2023 has set the foundation for a solid 2024 and beyond. Moving on to expectations for '24. Our outlook for the first quarter and full year can be found on Slide 12. Starting with the full year, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion, an 18% improvement versus 2023 with adjusted EBITDA margins expected to improve by almost 250 basis points. Adjusted net income is expected to be approximately $635 million with adjusted EPS expected at approximately $1.23, a 76% increase versus 2023. Before I get into our top-line expectations, there are a couple of important points to keep in mind for your models. First, given our strong expected net income growth for the year, shares related to our exchangeable notes are expected to be dilutive and are included in our share count for 2024. As a reminder, we must settle the exchangeable notes due in 2024 and 2025 in shares while both of our exchangeable notes due 2027 can be settled in cash or shares at our sole election. However, the accounting treatment requires we consider all notes as if they were settled in shares. As a result, we assume our full year 2024 average share count to be approximately 516 million. Secondly, we successfully migrated our tax residency from the U.K. to Bermuda as of December 31st, 2023, and we do not expect recently enacted Bermuda corporate income tax legislation to have a significant impact on our overall tax rate as this was already assumed in our planning. Taking a closer look at the components of the outlook. Occupancy is expected to be approximately 105%. Net yield is expected to increase approximately 5.5% inclusive of the headwinds from the outsized impact of the Middle East and Red Sea on our Oceania and Regent brands, primarily in the second and fourth quarter. For modeling purposes, our year yield growth will be highest in the first quarter as we are lapping lower load factors and a non-optimized itinerary mix in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, we are seeing strong demand for Caribbean sailings in the first quarter of 2024, which represents approximately 58% of our total deployment in the quarter. For the remainder of the year, yield growth is expected to return to more normalized levels despite the pressure from the aforementioned Middle East and Red Sea headwinds. Moving to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day, is expected to average approximately $159 for the full year. This represents a 3.4% increase versus full year 2023, but -- which includes the incremental impact of more dry-dock days in 2024. Excluding that impact, our core costs are essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. To put this in perspective, this effectively represents approximately $100 million of cost savings given our expected core inflation rate of around 3% for next year. For modeling purposes, keep in mind that 2023 had less dry-docks than normal as we took the opportunity to dry-docks ships while they were out of service. This year, we are returning to a more normalized dry-dock schedule and expect roughly a 175 dry-dock days in the year. This will impact adjusted cruise cost ex-fuel by approximately 325 basis points on a year-over-year basis or approximately $5 on a unit cost basis. This includes both the impact of dry-dock costs and the related reduction of capacity days. Excluding the impact of that, we expect full-year adjusted net cruise cost ex-fuel would be approximately $154 essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. Note that the timing of this impact is expected to be weighted more to the first half of the year, with approximately two-thirds of our dry-dock days occurring in that period. This year we will continue to be relentless in our efforts to enhance margins and reduce costs. We are leaving no stone unturned and are continually identifying opportunities, big and small, across the business. Our transformation office is running full speed ahead in identifying operating inefficiencies and operating -- and opportunities for improvement across all areas of our operating platform in order to enhance the acceleration of our margin recovery and related cash generation. One key focus area for us has been optimizing both our fuel consumption and bunkering strategies. Fuel costs are one of our largest expense line items, and our teams have been hard at work at fostering partnerships with the likes of DNV on decarbonization and long term agreements with industry leader ABB to drive new opportunities to lower our fuel consumption per capacity day. In addition to the consumption side of the equation we have made a big leap in the optimization of our fuel bunkering strategy that allows us to maximize price leverage across the various ports and suppliers we use during a season and, in many cases, even during a single voyage. We believe this will drive double-digit millions in savings in the first year alone. This is just one of the many examples that support our relentless drive to improve our unit costs and leverage our scale, all without impacting the guest experience. I look forward to sharing many more tangible examples at our upcoming investor day in May. The combination of our more efficient cost structure and strong expected top-line growth for the year is expected to drive the expansion of our full-year adjusted EBITDA margins up by approximately 250 basis points. Now, let's take a look at our expectations for the first quarter. As I said earlier, net yield is strong in the first quarter and is expected to increase approximately 15.5%. Adjusted net cruise cost ex-fuel per capacity day is expected to be $165 or approximately 3% versus the same quarter last year. As mentioned, we expect an increase in dry-dock days in the quarter, which will have a $6 or a 350-basis-point impact on adjusted net cruise cost in Q1. Excluding that impact, adjusted net cruise costs would be $159, essentially flat on a year-over-year basis, demonstrating our ability to offset the impact of inflation with our cost savings. As a result, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter is expected to be approximately $450 million. Adjusted net income is expected to be approximately $50 million. And adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately $0.12. Given the quarter is essentially complete, we do not expect significant outperformance in the top line versus expectations as the vast majority of our inventory is already sold. Any limited upside would result from our onboard revenue generating performance during the month of March. Moving on to our balance sheet and debt maturity profile on Slide 14. In 2023, we generated almost $2 billion of net cash from operating activities, which included $500 million return of cash collateral. And we repaid $1.9 billion of debt, including the full paydown of our $875 million revolving loan facility. Most recently, we successfully negotiated a refinancing of our $650 million backstop commitment from a secured to an unsecured basis. And in connection with this refinancing $250 million 9.75 secured notes due in 2028, our highest interest rate debt, is expected to be repaid. This refinancing, which is expected to close in early March will reduce interest expense, improve leverage while also releasing all of the related collateral, another important step forward in improving our balance sheet. Moving to leverage on Slide 15. The company has a solid track record of delevering the balance sheet. From 2014 to 2019, we successfully delevered by over three turns. We will continue to be opportunistic and look for further ways to strengthen our balance sheet. We are confident we can make meaningful progress on this front going forward. At year-end '23, with reported net leverage of approximately 7.3 times or approximately 6.75 times when excluding the impact of ships delivered in the second half of the year, we continue to expect significant improvement in this metric over time, driven by our organic cash generation and scheduled debt amortization payments. Over the course of 2024, we expect to reduce our reported leverage by almost 1.5 turns with sequential improvements in each quarter. This improvement does not assume any prepayment of debt, apart from the aforementioned takeout of our 250 million notes expected in early March. Going forward, we are refining a multiyear plan to further accelerate the reduction of leverage and derisk our balance sheet in order to drive shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it back to Harry for closing remarks. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/02/27/norwegian-cruise-line-nclh-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/
Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 01, 2023","Well, thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. Before we get into prepared remarks, if you haven't already heard the good news, I'd like to congratulate Jessica on her recent appointment to chief strategy officer for Regent Seven Seas Cruises. I'd also like to welcome Sarah Inmon, who recently joined the company, last week, as our new head of investor relations and corporate communications. We are very pleased to have Sarah on the team, and I'm sure many of you will have the chance to meet her in the weeks and months ahead. As she ramps up on the company, Jessica will continue to be available in the interim to ensure a smooth transition. Congratulations to you, Jessica, and congratulations to you, Sarah. Now, in turning to results, I'm pleased to share with you this morning that we achieved strong third quarter results generating record revenue and meeting or exceeding guidance on all key metrics. I have to attribute this success to the hard work and dedication of our incredible team members, both on our ships and our offices worldwide. We also continue to make good progress on both defining our longer-term strategic vision and executing on the near-term priorities I shared last quarter, which are shown on Slide 5. First, our team is focused on capitalizing on the strong demand environment for cruise to ensure we stay on our optimal booking curve, while maximizing pricing and onboard revenue generation. On a 12-month forward basis, our book position continues to be at record levels within our optimal ranges and at higher prices. While we are very pleased with our progress so far in building our book for 2024 and beyond, we are also keeping a close eye on the evolving macroeconomics and geopolitical landscape and are ready enable to adapt if needed. The next priority is rightsizing our cost base through our ongoing margin enhancement initiatives. Since we kicked off this initiative last year, we have seen sustained momentum with three consecutive quarters of improvement in our operating cost metrics. And what's even more encouraging is that we have done this without impacting the guest experience, as evidenced by our continued strong guest satisfaction level, continued strong onboard future cruise sales and guest repeat rates, and continued high onboard spend. These results have been driven by a palpable change in culture, with team members across the globe, shipboard and shoreside, embracing the challenge to find new and innovative ways to accelerate our margin recovery, while still preserving our long-term brand equity. To give you just one example, last month, we took the time to tour Norwegian Jewel ahead of the scheduled 2025 dry dock. We walked through each planned project while on board, stopping to get real-time guest feedback to help identify the highest value opportunities. The result of this more methodical approach resulted in not just lower cost, but also shortened the expected length of the dry docking itself by nine days, which will allow us to return the shift to revenue-generating service that much faster. All in all, the changes we made to the dry dock plan are expected to result in over 20% capex savings and a few million dollars of incremental revenue versus our original plan. It was a day well spent. While we have less of the lowest hanging fruit still available at this point, several opportunities like this remain untapped. I want to reassure you that we are committed to keeping the same relentless focus, vigilant, and balanced approach to identifying, evaluating, and executing on opportunities in a methodical manner. This is not a one-off exercise to us, but rather something we are embedding in the DNA of our entire organization. This leads us to our next priority, which is to make strategic and intentional enhancements to our offerings and guest experience. With the continued keen focus on costs, we are still making smart, high-return-generating modification and investments in our products and service offerings. For example, in the fourth quarter, we are launching Air Choice for Norwegian Cruise Line. This will allow guests to upgrade from our current bundled air offering in which guests are assigned flight at the line's discretion and allow them to choose their specific preferred flights for a fee. This is expected to have a dual benefit of improving both guest satisfaction and generating incremental revenue. We are also making disciplined investments in technology for better websites and mobile apps, to universal Starlink high-speed internet across our entire fleet by the end of 2024. Our high-value-targeted efforts to provide an excellent guest experience have not gone unnoticed. In fact, Norwegian Cruise Line was just named the top megaship cruise line by Conde Nast Traveler in their 2023 Readers' Choice Awards. Readers voted for their top choices based on several categories, including service, food, accommodations, and sustainability, and Norwegian Cruise Line won. So, it's clear that our product continues to resonate strongly with our guests. Turning to the fourth priority on the list. After welcoming Oceania Vista in May, in August, we took delivery of the incredible Norwegian Viva, the second ship in the game-changing Prima class, and we're not done yet. This year is the first year in our history in which we are introducing one ship for each brand, all of which were built with our incredible partners at Fincantieri in Italy. In just a few weeks, I will be heading back to Italy to take delivery of Regent Seven Seas Grandeur, which you can see on Slide 6. Grandeur rounds out the highly successful Explorer class for Regent, taking luxury cruising to another level. The reception for this ship continues to be overwhelmingly positive across the board, whether it's from our valued travel agents, our loyal pass guests, or guests trying one of our award-winning brands for the very first time. The disciplined addition of newbuilds continues to be a key cornerstone of our strategy as they are expected to be meaningful drivers of the company's future earnings growth and margin expansion. Our newbuild pipeline, which you can see on Slide 7, represents a 5% capacity growth CAGR from 2019 to 2028, and we are confident in our ability to absorb this growth profitably. We remain in talks with our shipbuilding partners to embark on a new vision for all three of our brands and plan to continue to add new ships across our brands at the right time and at the right interval. But for now, after the delivery of Grandeur this month, we have no additional ship delivery scheduled until spring of 2025. And in the interim, we expect to benefit from both organic growth, as well as the annualization of the 2023 newbuilds next year. The final priority on the list, shown on Slide 8, is charting a path to reduce leverage and derisk the balance sheet. While the return to investment grade like financial position will be a multiyear process, we continue to expect a significant organic improvement in our net leverage in the intermediate term, driven by our expected cash flow generation and normal course debt amortization payments. With new leadership and perspectives across our organization, we have embarked on a review of our entire business, taking a fresh look at all aspects of our strategy. We are embracing change while preserving what makes it special, and we are committed to take back a leadership position not just in cruise, but in the broader travel, leisure, and hospitality sector. In our view, no idea is too big or too small. We have a full vision for what the future holds for Norwegian, so we're taking the time to be thoughtful and thorough as we identify opportunities to ultimately drive more value for our shareholders. Our goal is to share this plan with all of you sometime in spring of next year, along with associated multiyear financial targets. Now, turning to Slide 9. As we focus on closing out the year strong, successfully executing on our near-term priorities and defining our long-term strategic plan and vision for the future, our team is more united and energized now more than ever. In fact, earlier this month, we held our global conference in Miami, the first time in several years that we have brought together leaders across all three of our amazing brands in person. This year's theme, next gen, was all about the future and how we can reach further individually and collectively to accelerate momentum as we move into 2024 and beyond. It was an opportunity to read the team together to spur innovation and collaboration and ensure that across the organization, we are all aligned and marching toward the same goals as we strengthen the foundation for sustained profitable growth. This served to further cement my confidence that we are taking the right steps today to best position the company for the future. Now, shifting our discussions to current bookings, demand and pricing trends, shown on Slide 10. We achieved record revenue of 2.5 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 33% over the same period in 2019. The strong consumer demand environment resulted in load factors of 106% in the third quarter while growing net per diems by nearly 8%, all while absorbing a 20% growth in capacity. Before we get into operational details, in recent months, we have seen the devastation caused by both the wildfires in Mali and the escalating conflict in Israel. Our thoughts and prayers are with those impacted by these tragic events. Our priority remains the safety, security, and well-being of our guests, team members, and the communities we visit. And we have mobilized to modify impacted itineraries and help support relief efforts in both regions. Starting with Hawaii, we were uniquely impacted compared to our cruise peers, given our unique year-round inter-island Hawaii offering, the only one in the industry, with our U.S.-flagged vessel, Pride of America. When the wildfires began in August, we quickly modified certain itineraries to avoid straining local resources. With the guidance and encouragement of a responsible return from both the Hawaiian governor, Josh Green, and the Hawaii Tourism Authority, we resumed our scheduled call to Kahului, Maui in early September. As it occurred in the past with events of this nature, which received significant attention and media coverage, we did experience a temporary slowdown in close-in bookings for Hawaii sales. This impacted not only Pride of America, but also certain sailings on Norwegian Spirit, also based in the region for much of the fall, which, in total, represent approximately 6% of our capacity in the fourth quarter. Demand has steadily improved in recent weeks. And while not quite fully recovered yet, it's on the right trajectory and now approaching normalized levels. While we expect some lingering impact in the first quarter, Hawaii only accounts for approximately 4% of capacity in this period, as well as for the full year, as Norwegian Spirit repositions outside of the region in December. Turning to Israel, once the conflict began to escalate, we canceled all calls to Israel for the remainder of the year. We recently made the pre-emptive decision to cancel calls in Israel in 2024 as well. And our brands are currently working diligently to modify itinerary and communicate these changes to guests. One of the benefits of our industry is that cruise ships are easily movable assets, so we can pivot as needed and still offer incredible itineraries for our guests to enjoy. However, we are seeing both elevated cancellation activity and lower new bookings for this region, primarily for close-in sailings, as the conflict is ongoing and still front and center in the consumer psyche. Prior to the conflict, approximately 7% of capacity in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 4% of capacity for the full year 2024 had visits to the broader Middle East region. Breaking 2024 down a bit further, very little capacity is in this region early in the year, only about 1% of capacity in Q1. That said, we are encouraged by the strength in our book position for 2024 and beyond, which, on a 12-month forward basis, remains in a record position at our optimal levels and at robust pricing levels. Onboard revenue generation, which we view as our single best real-time indicator of consumer confidence, also continues to knock it out of the park. During the quarter, gross onboard revenue for passenger cruise days was approximately 30% higher than the comparable 2019 period. This is driven not only by strong demand but also through our multiyear effort to enhance our bundled offerings and pull forward and pre-sell more revenue before a guest ever step foot on the ship, effectively expanding the sales cycle and getting more of the consumers' wallet over time. For the third quarter, pre-sold revenue on a per passenger day basis was up over 80% higher than in 2019 with nearly all of our guests purchasing something pre-cruise on their own or through our bundled offering. Not only does this lead to higher spend by guests over the course of their entire journey, but it also pulls forward cash inflows for the company. This is one of the reasons why, as you can see on Slide 11, our advanced ticket sales balance increased nearly 60% in the third quarter versus 2019, far outstripping capacity growth of 20%. Before I turn the call over to Mark, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, in which Slide 12 outlines key accomplishments and milestones. Since we last spoke, we partnered with the Global Maritime Forum to advance our shared mission of driving a positive change for the industry, environment, and society. We also joined its flagship initiative, the Getting to Zero Coalition, a powerful alliance with more than 200 organizations within the maritime, energy, infrastructure, and finance sectors committed to supporting the maritime industry in its journey toward full decarbonization by 2050. I'm also proud to share that we were recently recognized by Forbes in its World's Best Employers list for 2023. Our team members are, by far, our most important resource, and we are committed to their continued development and well-being. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mark for his commentary on our financial results and outlook. Mark? ","Thank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our third quarter 2023 financial results, 2023 guidance, and our financial position. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on net per diem, net yield, and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day metrics are on a constant currency basis, and comparisons are to the same period in 2019. Slide 13 highlights our third quarter results in which we are very pleased to report that we met or exceeded guidance for all key metrics. Focusing on the top line, results were strong with net per diems increasing nearly 8% and net yield increasing approximately 3%, both coming in at the high end of guidance. Turning to costs, adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day was in line with guidance at $152 in the quarter, demonstrating our third consecutive quarter of improvement since we began our cost reduction efforts in earnest late last year. As expected, this also included approximately $2 of certain nonrecurring benefits realized in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately 22 million higher than our guidance at approximately 752 million in the quarter. In addition, adjusted EPS of $0.76 also meet our projection by $0.06. Overall, we were very pleased with the strong results we generated in the third quarter. Shifting our attention to guidance, our outlook for the fourth quarter can be found on Slide 14. We are projecting very strong net per diem growth of approximately 15% to 16% and net yield growth of approximately 7.75% to 8.75%. Keep in mind, as we laid out last quarter, there are several factors contributing to the exceptionally strong pricing growth we are expecting in the fourth quarter, as a result of more luxury and upper premium capacity operating with our new Regent and Oceania ships, as well as the favorable comp from the rapid exit of Cuba in 2019. While this is still a strong result on a core basis, we have tempered revenue expectations since we last spoke, primarily on the back of lower occupancy. As Harry touched on earlier, we are experiencing impacts during the quarter from exogenous events in Hawaii and Israel, the latter of which also had implication for parts of the broader Middle East in the form of elevated cancellations and lower booking volumes. In addition, as Norwegian Cruise Line continues to fine-tune its differentiated strategy of longer, more premium itineraries, certain voyages in the late season, Eastern Mediterranean and parts of Asia performed slightly below expectations. While this resulted in a disconnect in the fourth quarter of 2023, our booking curves, guest sourcing, and marketing plans have already been recalibrated for similar sailings next year, resulting in a book position that is significantly better for the same period in 2024 compared to the same time last year. Shifting to operating costs. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to be approximately $151 in the fourth quarter. This also includes certain nonrecurring benefits that partially shifted from Q3 and that we do not expect to occur in 2024 and are also partially offset by costs related to inaugural activities. On a normalized basis, unit costs would have been approximately $153 in the quarter. Taking all this into account, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $360 million and adjusted EPS loss is expected to be approximately $0.15 on a projected diluted share count of approximately 425 million. Keep in mind that we have four outstanding exchangeable notes, which will cause variability in the diluted weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate EPS following the if-converted method. Slide 22 in our earnings deck has more information to help you with modeling. Now, shifting our focus to our outlook for the full year '23, we expect adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.86 billion, within the previous range of 1.85 billion to 1.95 billion, despite the headwinds expected in the fourth quarter. This is expected to translate to adjusted EPS of approximately $0.73 compared to prior guidance of $0.80. Taking a closer look at the components of the full year outlook, our healthy net per diem growth of approximately 9.25% to 9.75% is slightly narrowed versus previous guidance. Net yield growth is now expected to be 4.25% to 4.75% with capacity up 18%. Moving on to costs. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to average approximately $155 for the full year, better than our prior guidance of $156. This improvement is the result of the team's round-the-clock efforts to methodically rightsize our cost base. The savings we have identified have been broad-based and touching every aspect of the business, which you can see on Slide 16. I'm particularly proud of what we've been able to accomplish so far this year in the area of food costs. Since the fourth quarter of 2022, we have reduced these costs per passenger day by nearly 30%, significantly outpacing the easing and food inflation seen in the broader market. These are just a few of the many examples where we have been able to drive significant savings while still preserving the exceptional guest experience and superior service levels that our guests value. As we look ahead to 2024, while we are not ready to give guidance yet, there are a few moving pieces to keep in mind. For example, the timing of expenses, like dry docks, will cause variability in the NCC ex fuel metric when comparing periods. In 2023, we have limited dry docks as we took the opportunity during the pandemic to optimize the schedule while the ships were already out of service. In '24, we expect roughly 170 dry dock days, which will impact NCCs by approximately 300 basis points on a year-over-year basis or approximately $4 on a unit cost basis, including both the impact of the dry dock expenses, as well as the impact from reduced capacity days. Turning our attention to the balance sheet and our debt maturity profile on Slide 17, year to date through the third quarter, we generated over 1.7 billion of cash flow from operations. We've repaid 130 million debt in the quarter and approximately 1.5 billion of debt over the first nine months of the year. For the remainder of the year, we have approximately 330 million of scheduled debt payments, the vast majority of which are related to our export credit agency back to ship financing. In October, we successfully completed the refinancing of our operating credit facility, extending our debt maturity profile and providing incremental liquidity. Our revolving credit facility was upsized to 1.2 billion from 875 million with a three-year term maturing in October 2026. In addition, the company issued 790 million of 8.125% senior secured notes through 2029. The net proceeds, together with the cash on, hand were used to fully repay the approximately $800 million on our term loan A, which was to mature in January of '25. We were particularly pleased with the demand we saw for the new notes issuance. In addition to being significantly oversubscribed, we also saw substantial interest from new investors, reflecting increased confidence from the markets in our financial position and outlook. Turning to net leverage, we continue to expect significant improvement, driven by our organic cash generation and scheduled payment of debt installments. Excluding debt associated with our ships on order for future delivery, trailing 12-month net leverage is expected to be meaningfully reduced versus current elevated levels. This does not adjust for ships that are delivered in 2023, which would have the full debt load in the numerator without a full year of contribution included in adjusted EBITDA. Our liquidity position outlined on Slide 18 remains strong and would have been approximately $2.5 billion at quarter end, if adjusted for the upsizing of our revolver in October. We continue to believe that our strong liquidity position, coupled with our ongoing cash generation and attractive growth profile, provide a path to meet our near-term liquidity needs, including scheduled debt amortization payments and capital expenditures. With that, I'll turn it back to Harry for his closing comments. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/11/01/norwegian-cruise-line-nclh-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/
Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 01, 2023","Well, thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us here today. So today marks exactly one month since I began my new role as president and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. I'm humbled and honored to have been trusted to lead this incredible company, and I'm excited about the significant opportunities I see at. The responsibility they have to our best network of stakeholders, including our 40,000 team members worldwide, our guests our travel advisor partners, suppliers, lenders, shipyards, the over 700 communities we visit and all of you in the investment community is not something I take likely. Rest assured, my leadership team, the board of directors and I are committed to best positioning Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings for success. My focus now is squarely on the future and how we can refine and enhance our strategy to optimize our existing fleet of high-quality assets, further differentiate our business model, build resiliency, advance our efforts to drive a positive impact on society in the environment and ultimately drive more value to our shareholders and broader stakeholders. With new leadership not only in my seat, but in all three of our award-winning brands and most recently for our vessel operation function, there is a possible feeling of reinvigoration and excitement about the future across the entire company. We are approaching every decision with fresh perspective and new energy, challenging the status quo at every level and encouraging our entire team to think outside of the box and come to the table with new ideas, however big or small. Along with these changes, you can see for yourself on Slide 5 that while many of the senior leaders are new to their roles, there is still continuity and extensive experience among all of the leaders allowing for smooth transition without skipping a beat. Our executive team has an average of over 20 years in the cruise industry and nearly all has been with NCLH for a decade plus. I have the unlost confidence that this team is the right one to take the company to even greater heights. As we are fine-tuning our longer-term strategic vision and priorities, we are also focused on execution today, and Slide 6 outlines my near-term priorities. First, we are focused on capitalizing on the healthy demand environment for cruise, which I will talk about in more detail a little later in my commentary. At a high level, this means remaining within a booked position of approximately 60% to 65% on a 12-month forward basis while increasing pricing and maximizing onboard revenue generation. After years of experience, we believe this level will be the sweet spot based on our current deployment mix, and I am pleased to say we are comfortably in this range today. Our revenue management process is dynamic and we carefully monitor on a granular level how each ship itineranvoyage is tracking against its optimal booking curve and adjust marketing spend, promotional construct and pricing as needed depending on the market environment to maximize each voyage's contribution to the bottom line. The next priority is rightsizing our cost base through our ongoing margin enhancement initiatives. Mark will dive into more detail on the great progress we've already made on this critical effort but I want to emphasize that we have many additional opportunities in the pipeline to do even more, and we are not shying away from this challenge. The reality is we are operating against the different backdrop today than we were in 2019 requiring an even keener focus on balancing the top line with the cost structure that supports our unique business model and allows us to accelerate our margin recovery and help build resilience to vary external and macroeconomic environments. We are undertaking this effort with a strategic and data-driven approach that allows us to identify additional opportunities for efficiencies, sets, monitor and maintain accountability against concrete KPIs and increased agility to adapt quickly as market or consumer preferences evolve. I'm pleased to report that we're already seeing a change in the core culture of the company at every level of the organization to emphasize efficiency, cost mindfulness and results without impacting the guest experience. We built significant momentum in recent months with this initiative, and we look forward to demonstrating continued improvement in the coming quarters. This does tells nicely into our next priority, which is to make strategic and intentional modifications to enhance our offerings and better align them to our guests' needs and wants. There is no question that investment in our product and service offerings are critical to keeping our brand value propositions intact. However, we are refocusing the business on making smart investments in areas that generate the highest return and maximize guest satisfaction over the course of their entire cruise journey starting from the time they book. For example, we are deep in the development of a streamlined booking process at the Norwegian Cruise Line brand which uses generative AI technology to personalize the experience for guests, while also simplifying and reducing the number of considerations required to book by orders of magnitude. This, along with several other initiatives underway, should translate to more satisfied guests who spend more on board and return to sale with us more frequently, resulting in a win-win of higher yields and stronger loyalty. Turning to the fourth priority on the list. The entire team is hard at work preparing for the delivery of Norwegian Viva on Thursday, as well as Regent Seven Seas Grandeur in November, which you can see on Slide 7. I just came back from Italy where I visited the shipyards to check on their progress and I left even more excited than I was previously to welcome these new additions to our already guest and class slate. Both are sister ships to existing vessels that have been elevated even first so we have a high degree of confidence that there will be an overwhelmingly positive reception the ships from our guests and travel partners, which we are already seeing in their incredible advanced booked position. I'm also pleased that both are on schedule and on time for delivery despite supply chain and other challenges, a testament to our great working relationship we have developed with our partners at Fincantieri. In June, we announced that global Munich sensation in Aladdin music icon, Louis Fonsi, will serve as Godfather to Norwegian Viva. The announcement alone generated a reach of over 200 million globally, including new audiences in the targeted Spanish-language demographic. The ship will be christened in Miami later this year and home port in San Juan, Puerto Rico starting in December for a season of Caribbean itineraries. We also recently announced Seven Seas Grandeur Godmother Sarah Faberge, the great grand order of Peter Carl Faberge, the legendary artist jeweler and created an entrepreneurial genius to find a world renowned company that bears his name. This is a natural choice and celebration of Regions partnership with Faberge. The disciplined addition of new build is a key component to our strategy, and we have said consistently in the past, we welcome new hardware introductions as they not only generate excitement and bring more attention and awareness to our brand but they are expected to be meaningful drivers of the company's future earnings growth and margin expansion. As the smallest of the three large public cruise operators, we continue to believe that we have outsized opportunity to grow our footprint and meaningfully drive the bottom line. Our new build pipeline, which you can see on Slide 8, represents approximately 50% capacity growth by 2028 versus 2019, a CAGR of approximately 5%. After the delivery of three newbuilds in 2023, a record for the company, we have no additional ship delivery scheduled until spring of '25. In the interim, we expect to benefit from both organic growth, as well as the annualization of the 2023 new build next year. And lastly, the final priority on the list, but arguably the most important is starting the path to reduce leverage and derisk the balance sheet. Given the necessary actions we took to navigate the past few challenging years, our leverage ratios are currently not at optimal levels. Our goal remains to evaluate all options available and then clearly define a multiyear pathway to return to an investment-grade like financial position. This only happened overnight, but as you can see on Slide 9, the company has successfully reduced leverage in the past, and I am confident we will do so again. In the interim term, our expected cash flow generation boosted by our robust new build pipeline, along with normal course debt installment payments are expected to result in significant organic improvement in our net leverage. Over the next several months, we are focused on the successful execution of our near-term priorities while fine-tuning the future vision and strategy for the company with three strong brands, a world-class C and destiny industry, we are starting from a strong foundation and a position of strength. And I can say without a doubt that we have a bright future ahead with significant potential to unlock incremental value for our stakeholders. Shifting our discussion now to our current bookings demand and pricing trends. We achieved rental revenue of $2.2 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 33% over the same period in 2019. We have been able to tap into strong consumer demand environment, achieving the right balance of underlying revenue growth with net per diems up 6%, while at the same time materially growing our fleet with capacity of 19% for the quarter. We also kept our ships full, reaching a load factor of 105% in the second quarter, in line with guidance and a long awaited milestone as we return to normalized levels, which you can see on Slide 10. As previously mentioned and as illustrated on Slide 11, several years ago, we strategically shifted our deployment to longer, more immersive itineraries at the Norwegian Cruise Line brand and increased our concentration of premium destinations while reducing our Caribbean deployment. This was designed to attract a higher quality guest and maximize our competitive position. A natural bright product of this new deployment mix is left third and fourth passengers in the cabin, which is what historically pushed passenger occupancy above the 100% mark. As a result, we expect full year occupancy going forward to be roughly 200 basis points lower than 2019 levels. This shift also resulted in an elongation of our booking window which was 255 days in the second quarter, an increase of 51 days or 20% compared to the same quarter in 2019 and meaningfully enhancing our future visibility and reducing our exposure to volatile and less predictable cost in bookings. Thinking together, we believe this strategy will drive higher yields, higher guest satisfaction and higher guest repeat rates with longer runway to optimize our pricing and marketing strategy as macro environment evolved over time. Turning to Slide 12. Our cumulative book position for the second half of 2023 remains ahead of 2019's record performance and at higher prices another indication of continued healthy demand environment and the resilience of our target consumer. This strength continues past this year to sailings in 2024 and beyond, which at this point in the booking curve is our primary focus. In fact, over the past 90 days, over 70% of our ticket sales were for 2024 and '25 sailings, considerably higher than in 2019. Onboard revenue generation, our best real-time indicator of how consumers are feeling financially today also continues to perform exceptionally well. During the quarter, gross onboard revenue for passive Cruise Day was approximately 30% higher than the comparable 2019 period. Our efforts to enhance our market-leading bundled offerings and increase quality touch points with our guests starting from the time of booking and continuing throughout their cruise journey are clearly bearing fruit. In fact, presold revenue on a per passenger day basis for the second quarter of 2023 was over 75% higher than in 2019. An important contributor to our onboard revenue strength as these guests tend to spend more overall throughout their journey than guests who do not pre-book onboard activities. Before I turn the call over to Mark, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, in which Slide 14 outlines key accomplishments and milestones. Since we last spoke, we published our annual Sail & Sustain report and disclosure on World Environmental Day in June. The report provides transparency in our progress and initiatives on top ESG priorities. Some of the highlights this year for more detail on our new climate action strategy and enhanced data and disclosures on community impact, human capital and greenhouse gas emission reported. In addition, we demonstrated progress against several of our environmental goals, including targets to equip our ships with short power capabilities and reduced bunkering of freshwater. I encourage all of you to take some time to explore the report and welcome -- I'm sorry, to explore the report and visit our website for more information. I'm also proud to share that just last week, we announced the winners of our annual Giving Joy recognition program that has been celebrating teachers across North America since 2019 for their hard work and relentless dedication. Each of the 20 winning educators want a free seven-day voyage for two and the top three grand prize winners were invited to attend the exclusive cresting voyage for Norwegian Depot. This year's content drew support from over 3,400 teachers across the U.S. and Canada and garnered hundreds of thousands of lots. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark for his commentary on our financial position and outlook. Mark? ","Thank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our second quarter 2023 financial results, 2023 guidance and our financial position. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on net per diem, net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics are on a constant currency basis and comparisons are to the same period in 2019. Slide 15 highlights our second quarter results in which we are very pleased to report that we've met or exceeded guidance for all key metrics. Focusing on the top line, results were strong with revenue per up 33% and net per diems increasing approximately 6.5%, surpassing the high end of guidance, while net yield was in line with guidance at 2.9%. Keep in mind that comparisons to 2019 includes certain premium-priced Baltic and Cuba voyages in that year, which did not operate in 2023. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity day, came in below in the quarter, demonstrating further improvement from the prior quarter and the high watermarks seen in the second half of 2022. The reduction in cost this quarter was primarily driven by lower food costs and crew optimization efforts as we continue to realize the benefits of cost savings initiatives identified and implemented during the first phase of this initiative. I will note that across all three brands, our guest satisfaction scores remain strong, reflecting our continued focus on cost rationalization without impacting the guest experience. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $30 million higher than our guidance at approximately $515 million in the quarter. In addition, adjusted EPS of $0.30 also beat our projection by $0.05, and was the first time we generated positive EPS since 2019, as well as the first time that our quarterly adjusted EBITDA exceeded the same quarter in 2019. Shifting our attention to guidance. Our out for the third quarter can be found on Slide 16. We are projecting net per diem growth of approximately 7% to 8% and net yield growth of approximately 2.25% to 3.25%. Similar to the second quarter, the loss of certain premium priced Baltic itineraries will continue to impact the comparison versus 2019. In the fourth quarter, pricing and yield are both expected to exhibit mid-teens growth compared to 2019. There are several other factors contributing to the exceptionally strong growth we are expecting for the fourth quarter which include more luxury and upper premium capacity operating with the new region and Oceania ships, as well as a favorable comp from the rapid exit from Cuba in 2019 and the close in resale of those sailings. Adjusting for these factors, net per diem growth is still expected to be up approximately 10%, which reflects our organic pricing power and strong consumer demand that Harry referred to, as well as the benefit of our shift to premium deployments with extended Alaska and Europe seasons this year. Given that we have already -- we already have a substantial booked position and our pace of bookings is on track with our optimal booking curves. This gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on this top line outlook for the fourth quarter. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to be approximately $152 in the third quarter which includes approximately $3 of certain nonrecurring benefits realized in the quarter. Looking ahead, there are also onetime expenses associated with new capacity additions in the fourth quarter. Adjusting for these items, this metric is expected to slightly decrease quarter over quarter, which is noted on Slide 17. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter is expected to be approximately $730 million, and adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately $0.70 on a projected diluted share count of approximately 510 million shares. Keep in mind that we have our four outstanding exchangeable notes, which will cause variability in the diluted weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate EPS when we follow the if-converted method. It is also important to note that despite our ability to settle our two 2027 exchangeable notes in cash rather than its shares, these notes would still be included in our diluted weighted average shares outstanding for GAAP reporting purposes, if they are dilutive in the quarter. We've included an additional slide in our earnings deck, Page -- Slide 24, with more information to help with modeling. Now, shifting our focus to our outlook for the full year 2023, we are raising the floor of our adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion despite approximately $30 million of headwinds for our interest and fuel expense in the back half of the year. This is expected to translate to adjusted EPS of approximately $0.80 or $0.05 above our prior guidance, reflecting the second quarter outperformance. As you can see on Slide 18, since we first guided for the year in February, we have increased our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 or 14% on strong results in the underlying business which overcame headwinds from higher fuel FX and interest rates. Excluding these headwinds, adjusted EPS growth versus initial guidance would have been approximately 20 percentage points higher. Taking a closer look at the components of the full year outlook, our healthy net per diem growth of approximately 9% to 10.5% as compared to 2019 and net yield growth guidance of approximately 5% to 6.5% are unchanged versus our prior guidance with capacity up 18%. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel first capacity date is expected to average approximately $156 for the full year better than the prior guidance of $159, reflecting lower-than-expected costs in the second quarter. As we have previously mentioned, when comparing this metric to 2019, please note that we do not have the benefit from the disposal of older, less efficient tonnage that some of our peers have. And we have also added capacity at our high-end Oceania Regent brands, which while accretive to margins do have higher operating costs. Another thing to keep in mind is that the timing of expenses such as dry docks can cause variability in these metrics when comparing different periods. For example, in 2023, we have limited dry docks as we took the opportunity during the pandemic to optimize the schedule while ships were already out of service. As Harry noted earlier, this improvement is the result of the deliberate actions we have taken to enhance margins and rightsize our cost base. To further supplement our internal efforts, which have been in full force since we kicked off this initiative last fall. We have also more recently engaged a third-party consultant to benchmark best practices across sectors and identify incremental areas of opportunity. Our entire team is working around the clock to find ways to accelerate our margin recovery, and we are leaving no stone unturned in the process. To date, the savings we have identified in the broad-based have been broad-based, touching every aspect of the business with the largest buckets consisting of fuel, food and consumables and marketing, as shown on Slide 19. To give you an example of one of the initiatives we are undertaking, we are optimizing crew movements and reducing ship crew transfers, which we expect to result in multimillion dollars savings. To put this into context, each year, we have approximately 90,000 crew movements including 6,000 or so between ships. This is just one example, but it demonstrates how incremental changes can add up to a larger impact on the bottom line. We recognize that we still have more work to do, and we are committed to doing so in a way that preserves the exceptional guest experience and superior service levels that our target higher-end guests expect from our brands all while setting us up well for continued margin improvement in the next few years. Turning our attention to the balance sheet and our debt maturity profile on Slide 20. In the first half of the year, we generated over $1.5 billion of cash flow from operations, including over $1 billion in the second quarter. This allowed us to repay approximately $1.4 billion of debt including the full paydown of our $875 million revolving credit facility. In addition, we have approximately $475 million of scheduled debt payments for the back half of the year, the vast majority of which are related to our export credit agency-backed ship financing. As we have previously stated, we intend to refinance our operating credit facility in the normal course of business before year-end. As mentioned earlier, we expect our net leverage to improve significantly, driven by our organic cash flow generation and payment of scheduled debt installments. Excluding debt associated with ships on order for future delivery, trailing 12 months net leverage is expected to meaningfully reduce versus current elevated levels dropping below six times over the course of the first half of 2024. This does not adjust for ships that were delivered in 2023 which would have the full debt load in the numerator without a full year of contribution included in adjusted EBITDA. Turning to liquidity. Our overall liquidity position remains strong at approximately $2.4 billion at quarter end, as outlined on Slide 21. This consists of approximately $900 million of cash and cash equivalents, $875 million under our revolver and a $650 million undrawn commitment. This does not include the separate $300 million undrawn backstop commitment, which enhances our future liquidity, but is not currently available to draw. During the quarter, we received approximately $500 million of cash collateral back from a credit card processor. This collateral release not only provided a meaningful increase to liquidity but was also a very strong signal that our external partners have increased confidence in our financial position and future outlook. Overall, I feel the same optimism about the direction of our business. I want to echo Harry's comments that our entire management team is reinvigorated and focused on delivering on our business and strategic goals while also pursuing all opportunities to maximize value creation and create a more nimble and resilient organization for the future. With that, I'll turn it back to Harry for closing comments. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/norwegian-cruise-line-nclh-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/
Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 01, 2023","Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Today marks a significant milestone for me, as it is my 34th and final earnings call as president and CEO of this incredible company before my upcoming retirement, which was announced just over a month ago. In 2015, I was given the opportunity to lead Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings into its next chapter, one where we brought together three of the industry's leading brands, Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises, and Regent Seven Seas Cruises to form the best cruise operator in the industry. After eight incredible years, it is now time for me to make way for the next generation of leaders who are ready and energized to take this company onto greater heights. Before getting to the crux of the call, I want to take a moment to thank all of Norwegian's team members around the globe, shipboard, and shore side, who are the backbone of this company and who are the main driver of its success. I also want to express my sincere appreciation to our loyal guests, valued travel partners, lenders, shipyards, investors, analysts, and all of our stakeholders for your continued support and partnership over the years. I'm incredibly proud of you. I'm very proud of what we have been able to collectively achieve, especially over the past few extremely challenging years, but I know that the best days for this company still lie ahead, and I look forward to seeing what you all accomplish together. With Harry Sommer at the helm, I leave this company in the most capable of hands. As Slide 5 shows, Harry has a broad range and depth of experience that makes him one of the premier executives in the industry. I have worked with Harry in various capacities over the course of three decades, and I can assure you that he is a strategic and innovative leader, who has the right talent, skill set, and energy to lead the company at this pivotal time in its history. As a long-standing cruise industry and company veteran, he brings both continuity and a fresh perspective to this seat. We have been working together along with our board of directors and the rest of the senior management team for some time now to ensure a seamless transition, and I am confident that NCLH will not skip a beat as we continue to push forward and capitalize on the momentum we are experiencing today. Now, there are times when fate meets circumstances, and this happens to be one of those times, as my departure coincides not only with the 20th anniversary of the founding of Oceania Cruises, but also the delivery of the seventh ship in the Oceania fleet, the incomparable Vista, which you can see details about on Slide 6. With great pride, we took delivery of this amazing ship just last week, bringing NCLH's total fleet to 30 vessels with over 60,000 berths. We are heading over to Europe this week where Vista will be christened in Malta by her godmother, Emmy Award-winning food personality, Giada de Laurentiis. At 1,200 guests, Vista is the first of two Allura class ship for the line, with the second ship named Allura expected in 2025. These ships will further elevate and cement Oceania Cruise's leading position in the upper premium cruise space. I have to thank our partners at Fincantieri once again for bringing our vision to life and delivering a truly magnificent ship. What is even more exciting is that this is just the first of three newbuilds that we have in the pipeline this year, with Norwegian Viva and Regent Seven Seas' Grandeur joining the fleet later this year. New hardware introductions generate excitement from those new to cruise and new to brand, as well as with our loyal past guests. So, three ships in one year will mean that much more of a halo effect for our company to leverage. Given their very efficient financing structures made possible to the unique nature of the industry's interconnected financing ecosystem, new ships are able to contribute immediately and are expected to be meaningful drivers of the company's future earnings growth and margin expansion. So, now I'll turn the call over to Harry, who will be tasked with delivering on the significant potential upside we see ahead, to provide an update on the current environment and the key catalyst we have in the horizon. Harry? ","Thank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. Before I dive into the financial results and outlook, I want to also thank Frank for all that he has done to propel this company forward, as well as his outstanding leadership. I look forward to continuing to partner with Harry in his new role as we work to capitalize on the momentum we are experiencing in order to maximize value for all of our stakeholders. My commentary today will focus on our first quarter 2023 financial results, 2023 guidance, and the progress on our financial recovery. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on net per diem, net yield, and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics, is on a constant currency basis. Slide 13 highlights our first quarter results, in which we are pleased to report that we met or exceeded guidance for all key metrics. Focusing on the top line, total revenue per passenger cruise day in the quarter was up approximately 18% versus 2019. Net per diem increased approximately 7.7%, achieving the high end of guidance, while net yield of 3.6% was a healthy beat versus our expectations, as low factor of 101.5% came in well ahead of projections. With significantly higher participation as a result of enhancements to our bundled offerings today when compared to '19, the accounting allocation between ticket and onboard revenue has also changed, which can skew the comparison. Therefore, we focus on total net per diem and net yield as a better holistic representation of our pricing power. Turning to costs, adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity day, averaged $161.25, better than expected and approximately 14% lower than the run rate in the second half of 2022. This reflects the rapid execution of cost savings initiatives identified and implemented last year, some of which were realized earlier than anticipated. This includes improvements in areas such as supply chain initiatives, back office optimization, as well as crew costs and travel expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was nearly $40 million higher than our guidance at approximately $234 million in the quarter. In addition, adjusted EPS loss of $0.30 also beat our guidance. Shifting our attention to guidance, our outlook for the second quarter can be found on Slide 14. As we have stated previously, the second quarter will complete our occupancy ramp-up. In addition, comparisons to 2019 includes certain premium price Baltic and Cuba voyages in that year, which we did not operate in 2023. As a result, growth is in line with our expectations, with net per diem increasing approximately 5.5% to 6.25%, and net yield expected to increase approximately 2.5% to 3.25%. Pricing and yield are both expected to increase in the second half of the year, with the fourth quarter exhibiting the strongest growth versus 2019. This is driven by our organic pricing power and in part by a favorable comp, as the second half of 2019 included various headwinds, like the rapid exit from Cuba and the close in resale of those sailings. Fourth quarter is also expected to benefit from our strategic shift to premium deployments with extended Alaska and European seasons this year, as well as a mixed shift with more capacity operating for our Regent and Oceania brands. Given our robust book position for the second half of 2023, which is ahead of 2019, we have good visibility into the balance of the year. which gives us confidence that we can achieve this sequential improvement in year over-year-growth. Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day, is expected to be approximately $159 in the second quarter, a further improvement versus the prior quarter as additional savings initiatives are realized. We continue to expect modest sequential improvement each quarter in 2023 as occupancy increases and as a result of initiatives which have already been identified and implemented. This should result in a lower run rate cost level exiting 2023 than our full year reported results. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter is expected to be approximately 485 million, which is roughly the same level as EBITDA in the same quarter of 2019, another stepping stone to closing the gap versus pre-pandemic levels. I am also pleased to report that we expect to achieve another significant milestone in the quarter with adjusted EPS turning positive for the first time since the pandemic at approximately $0.25 per share. Now, shifting our focus to our outlook for the full year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA is still expected to be in the range of 1.8 billion to 1.95 billion, with the high end of our targeted range representing record adjusted EBITDA for the company. This is expected to translate to adjusted EPS of approximately $0.75 cents or $0.05 above our prior guidance, reflecting the first quarter outperformance partially offset by higher anticipated fuel costs and effects for the remainder of the year. Taking a closer look at the components of the full year outlook, net per diem growth of approximately 9% to 10.5% as compared to 2019 and net yield growth guidance of approximately 5% to 6.5% are unchanged versus our prior guidance. Moving on to costs, adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day, is expected to average approximately $159 for the full year, slightly better than our prior guidance. and reflecting lower than expected costs in the first quarter. This represents a 15% decrease as compared to the average of $187 in the second half of 2022. As Harry noted, we continue to evaluate all opportunities to accelerate revenue and improve operating efficiencies and are taking deliberate actions to improve our margins, while maintaining the exceptional guest experience and superior service levels our brands are known for. We look forward to continuing to demonstrate this improvement over the coming quarters. Turning our attention to the balance sheet, Slide 15 provides our debt maturity profile, which includes approximately 800 million of scheduled debt service for the remainder of the year, the vast majority of which is related to our export credit agency-backed ship financing. We've talked previously about the actions taken earlier this year to address a large portion of our 2024 maturities, so I won't go into further details today, but a summary is provided on Slide 16 for your reference. Since we last spoke, we also signed agreements to increase our ECA-backed commitments by approximately 1.7 billion euro. This was primarily to finance improvements and modifications to newbuilds currently on order across our three brands. This includes the previously communicated changes to the last four Prima class ships to make them up to 20% larger than the first-generation ships, as well as the addition of the methanol-ready configuration to the last two ships to increase optionality and help future-proof these long-life assets and reach our decarbonization goals. The financing also covers older supplies associated with preparing certain newbuilds to enter service, as well as related financing premiums. While we originally planned to fund this with our organic cash flow generation when the ships were originally ordered, given the very efficient and supportive financing we received from export credit agencies and the continued uncertainty in the macro and financial markets, we felt financing this was a prudent action to minimize cash outflows for the next few years. Turning to liquidity, our overall liquidity position remains strong at approximately 1.9 billion as outlined on Slide 17. This consists of approximately 700 million of cash and cash equivalents, nearly 600 million of availability under our revolver, and our 650 million undrawn commitment. This does not include the separate 300 million undrawn backstop commitment, which enhances our future liquidity but is not currently available to draw. I want to reiterate our commitment and relentless focus on delivering value for all of our key stakeholders. We will continually evaluate options to accelerate our recovery while maintaining adequate financial flexibility to adapt to different macroeconomic backdrops. Overall, we feel optimistic about the direction of our business, and we believe we are taking the right steps today create a more nimble and resilient organization for the future. With that, I'll turn it back to Frank for closing comments. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/01/norwegian-cruise-line-nclh-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 28, 2023","Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2022 was a year like no other in our company's 56-year history as we successfully concluded our great cruise come back, with the last vessel in our fleet reentering service midway through the year. Our team continually push forward to this challenging transition year, achieving several significant milestones on our road to recovery and preparing for the next chapter of our storied brands. With our full fleet back to the high seas, we significantly ramped up occupancy levels carrying nearly 1.7 million guests welcomed our newest ship, Norwegian Prima to our world-class fleet, reached several critical financial inflection points, maintained our industry-leading pricing, and perhaps, more telling, ended the year in a record-book position for 2023 and at record prices. These accomplishments are even more impressive when considering they were achieved against the backdrop of lingering COVID-19 impacts, as well as ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. I want to take the opportunity to once again thank our entire team, both shore-side and shipboard, for their hard work, dedication, and tenacity, which has propelled us forward as we strive to be the vacation of choice for everyone around the world. I'm incredibly proud, honored, and inspired to work alongside each and every one of you. And I also want to express our sincere thanks to our loyal guests, value travel partners, lenders, shipyards, investors, and all of our stakeholders for their continued support and partnership. Shifting our attention to what is certainly a bright future for our company, let's turn to Slide 6, which outlines our current positioning and the key catalysts we have on the horizon. First, we are encouraged to see that our target consumer, which tends to skew more upmarket in the broader cruise industry, continues to be financially healthy and resilient and is prioritizing consumption of experiences over the purchase of physical goods. We've talked previously about the two high-level indicators we carefully monitor to evaluate the willingness of consumers to spend on cruise travel. The first being the length of the booking curve, which is a forward-looking indicator, and the second one being onboard revenue, a real-time indicator of a consumer's actual spending, both of which continue to hold strong with no signs of fading. In fact, the booking window in the fourth quarter was well elongated compared to the same quarter in 2019. Onboard revenue also continues to be a bright spot with gross onboard revenue per passenger cruise day in the quarter, approximately 25% higher than the comparable 2019 period. The bottom-line is our target consumer continues to be willing to spend on travel and experiences now and in the future. This gives us confidence that, not only is the incredible value proposition for cruising resonating with consumers, but the unique and compelling offerings of our three brands are also appealing to their respective markets. Second, we are taking actions across our business to align with our strategic priorities and strengthen the foundation for sustained profitable growth. This includes a broad and ongoing initiative we began in the fourth quarter to improve operating efficiencies and to right-size our cost base so that we can rebuild and enhance our margins. You may ask, why start this initiative now? While the past few years have been unlike anything we could have imagined. First, we were focused on taking the necessary measures to withstand a prolonged and unprecedented period of disruption by minimizing cash burn, raising capital, enhancing our health and safety programs to adapt to a rapidly evolving public health environment, and advocating for the industry to restart cruise operations. We then shifted our focus to relaunching our operations while providing our discerning guests the same unparalleled vacation experience they expect from our leading brands. We also took this unique opportunity to raise the bar on pricing for the long-term. Now that our phased occupancy ramp is nearly complete and our loyal guests know that cruising in our brands is back and even better than before, we are squarely focused on how to maximize profitability as we embark on a period of transformational growth. Every aspect of our business is being evaluated through the lens of how we can realize our full value potential for all stakeholders. We are exploring further opportunities, first and foremost, to reduce our cost profile and to maximize revenue generation. You've likely seen some of the actions we've already taken to improve our cost structure, including normalization of marketing spend, corporate overhead reductions, itinerary optimization, supply chain initiatives, and thoughtful rationalization of product delivery. We will continue to leave no stone on turn as we identify and evaluate incremental opportunities. And, of course, we will not lose sight of our guests, the very heart of our business, and we will continue to prioritize delivering an exceptional guest experience and superior service levels. The last catalyst I want to touch on is our industry-leading newbuild pipeline. This year, for the first time in our history, we are gearing up to deliver one newbuild for each of our brands, as shown on Slide 7, adding over 5,000 additional berths to our fleet including an over 20% increase in our upscale berths. On a capacity-day basis, this will result in approximately 19% growth in 2023 compared to 2019. As you can see on Slide 8, we have made some modifications to our newbuild pipeline primarily related to the last two shifts in the Prima Class. These ships have been lengthened in part to accommodate the future use of alternative fuels. We now expect gross tonnage for the third and fourth Prima Class to be approximately 10% larger and the fifth and sixth Pima Class ships to be approximately 20% larger than Norwegian, Prima, and Viva. As a result, delivery days have shifted a bit, and we now expect one larger Prima Class ship to be delivered each year from 2025 through 2028. We remain confident in our ability to profitably absorb this capacity with continued consumer demand for travel, our expansion into the many unserved and underserved markets around the world that our brands have not yet tapped into, and on the broader industry's vast under-penetration, particularly, when compared to land-based vacation alternatives. Shifting our discussion now to our booking, demand and pricing trends. As you can see on Slide 9, in the fourth quarter, our load factor reached 87%, in line with guidance. This is approximately 20% below the comparable 2019 quarter, yet demonstrates another sequential improvement in closing the occupancy gap versus 2019. This ramp is continuing through the first quarter of 2023 as we have already achieved 100% occupancy in the quarter, leading to a return to historical levels beginning in the second quarter of 2023 and beyond. In terms of pricing, Slide 10, illustrates another strong result in the pricing front with our net per DM growth in the fourth quarter of 2022, up approximately 14% on an as-reported basis and up 15% in constant currency over 2019. Turning to Slide 11, at year-end, our cumulative book position for 2023 was within our optimal range of approximately 60% to 65%. We continue to believe this is our sweet spot as it strikes the delicate balance of encouraging guests to book early while also optimizing pricing. Full-year 2023 book position is now ahead of 2019's record performance and at higher prices. Since we last spoke in November, we have been pleased to see positive booking momentum continue, including a very strong wave season that likely started two months earlier than usual. In fact, November was a record-breaking month for Norwegian Cruise Line as they celebrate a record day, record week, and record month of sales boosted by Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday push. Subsequently, in January, a strong start to traditional wave led the line of setting another record-booking month. Our Regent brand also experienced a similar positive reception to it 2023 wave offer launch which resulted in a record launch day with net booking volume nearly four times last year's wave launch and 2019 prepandemic levels. Our current cumulative book position and the strong demand dynamics that we continue to experience across our brands gives us further confidence that we can achieve our 2023 guidance, which Mark will discuss shortly in more detail. I'll be back with closing comments a little later. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his commentary on our financial position and outlook. Mark? ","Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our fourth-quarter 2022 financial results, 2023 guidance, and the progress on our financial recovery. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on net per diem, net yield, and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics, is on a constant-currency basis. Slide 12 outlines key metrics highlighting our fourth-quarter results, nearly all of which met or exceeded guidance. Focusing on the top line, strong ticket pricing and onboard revenue generation drove total revenue per passenger cruise in the quarter, up approximately 24% versus 2019, with net per diems increasing approximately 15%, continuing the strong pricing performance we have achieved since our relaunch. Turning to costs, adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity day, was in line with expectations, with the second half 2022 decreasing approximately 10% versus the first half as our operations continue to ramp up. As our 2023 guidance indicates, second-half 2022 is not representative of a go-forward run rate. For the second half of 2022, adjusted EBITDA was nearly breakeven. We did, however, achieve another significant milestone in the fourth quarter, generating positive adjusted free cash flow for the first time in three years. This represents another stepping stone as we return to a normalized operating environment. Looking at expectations for the full-year 2023 on Slide 14, we are pleased to return to our normal cadence of providing annual and quarterly guidance. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 1.8 billion to 1.95 billion, with the high end of our targeted range, representing record adjusted EBITDA for the company. This is expected to translate to adjusted EPS of approximately $0.70 at the midpoint of our guidance. Taking a closer look at the components of this outlook, net per diem growth is expected in the range of approximately 9% to 10.5% as compared to 2019. This translates to net yield for the year expected to increase in the range of 5% to 6.5%. This stellar top-line performance is reflective of our go-to-market strategy and emphasis on price discipline. Moving to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel per capacity day is expected to average approximately $160 for the full year. This represents a nearly 15% decrease as compared to the average of $187 in the second half of 2022. The key drivers of this expected decrease includes the scaling back and normalization of marketing investments, which were elevated in the second half of 2022 as we focused on resetting expectations and raising the bar on pricing during our relaunch; moderation in hyperinflationary pressures in certain areas, including food and logistics; normalization of capacity days as a result of the elimination of previously acquired protocols; timing and optimization of scheduled drydocks; and, finally, the results of our operating efficiency and cost minimization efforts as part of our broad and ongoing margin enhancement initiative that Frank touched on. Keep in mind that costs are expected to sequentially trend lower over the course of the year as occupancy increases and reduction initiatives are realized, which is expected to lead to a lower cost run rate as we exit 2023 as compared to our full-year guidance. As we have consistently communicated, our costs will be elevated when compared to 2019 baseline, both due to normal and hyperinflation over the past three years to four years, as well as a mixed headwind as we add higher operating cost capacity, which we do expect will gain a premium on the top line. I want to reiterate that we are committed to right-sizing our cost base and are taking deliberate actions across our business to best position us for the future as a stronger and leaner organization. There is no silver bullet, but we will continue to evaluate all opportunities to accelerate revenue and improve operating efficiencies, while continuing to deliver an exceptional guest experience. Our goal is not only to rebuild our margins, but over time, continue to enhance them. And we look forward to demonstrating this improvement over the coming quarters. Now, let's take a look at our expectations for the first quarter. Compared to 2019 levels, net per diem is expected to increase approximately 6.75% to 7.75%, while net yield is expected to increase approximately 1.25% to 2.25%, primarily as a result of our continued occupancy ramp and with pricing expected to be higher for the remaining quarters of 2023. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to be approximately $165 or approximately 12% below the second half of 2022. First quarter is expected to be the highest-cost quarter due to lower occupancy and as actions taken in recent months to reduce costs will not yet be fully realized. When looking at our implied guidance for the remaining quarters of 2023, the expected decrease in cost is approximately 16% compared to the same period in 2022. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter is expected to be approximately $195 million, and adjusted EPS is expected to be a loss of approximately $0.45. Moving to our balance sheet. Slide 15 demonstrates the results of our deliberate and opportunistic measures to optimize our debt maturity profile. In 2023, we have approximately 1 billion of scheduled debt service, the vast majority of which are related to our export credit agency-backed ship financing. In recent months, we also addressed a large portion of our 2024 maturities. First, we completed an amendment of our operating credit facility and extended approximately 1.4 billion of this facility by one year to January 2025. Earlier this month, we took advantage of significant improvements in the bond markets to complete a refinancing transaction of the remaining nonextended term loans under the operating credit facility. We issued 600 million of new 8.375% senior secured notes due 2028 and used the proceeds to repay these term loans, allowing us to derisk and replace near-term debt maturities with longer-dated debt at only a marginally higher cost. As you can see, with these actions, we have a manageable maturity profile over the course of the next few years. When you look at the totality of our debt, approximately 40% is ECA back debt. This is a unique differentiator of the cruise industry, which is part of a broader connected ecosystem, which includes, among others, the operators, the shipyards, and the governments, and export credit agencies, all of which rely on shipyards and suppliers for significant economic and employment-related benefits. As all of our interests closely align, these partners are incredibly supportive as demonstrated by the very efficient financing we are able to secure for our newbuilds, as well as the support they provided during the pandemic. For additional detail on the breakdown of upcoming debt payments, we also provide a detailed schedule on our investor relations website. Turning to liquidity, our overall liquidity position remains strong. And just last night, we announced two transactions, which further enhance our liquidity and outlined on page -- on Slide 16. First, we revised and extend our existing 1 billion undrawn backstop commitment. As part of the agreement to secure a second year extension option on the commitment, the company issued 250 million of 9.75% notes due 2028. At the same time, we revised the undrawn commitment to reduce the amount to 650 million, with the agreement now extending through February 2024, with the option at our sole election to extend through 2025. We do not currently intend to draw on this commitment. And in total, the combination of these two actions provides the company approximately 900 million of liquidity to the bottom line. Second, we also entered into a new 300 million unsecured and undrawn backstop commitment. This facility will be available to draw beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023. Securing this facility provides a backstop for the remaining portion of the nonextending operating credit facility which matures in January 2024. Pro forma for these recent transactions, our liquidity position at year-end is approximately 1.8 billion, which includes approximately 650 million, under the available commitment. For housekeeping, this does not include the enhancement to future liquidity we obtained with the 300 million undrawn commitment as it is currently not available to draw. Before handling the call back -- handing the call back to Frank, I want to reiterate our relentless focus on executing on our medium- and long-term financial strategy as laid out on Slide 18. We will continue to be opportunistic and are committed to delivering value for all stakeholders. But most of all, we are excited to be back in full operation and, once again, delivering incredible vacation experiences on our three brands to all corners of the globe. With that, I'll turn it back to Frank for closing comments. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/28/norwegian-cruise-line-nclh-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) Q3 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 08, 2022","Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report that we reached another significant achievement on our road to recovery this quarter with a generation of positive adjusted EBITDA for the first time since the pandemic began. We have been clear about our intentional and methodical return to service strategy, consistently meeting or even exceeding the operational and financial milestones we had guided to. I am encouraged by our progress as each quarter has seen substantial sequential improvement in load factor, with the shortfall gap continuing to narrow versus pre-pandemic levels while our industry-leading pricing continues to hold strong. And while we are always looking for ways to capitalize on opportunities to accelerate our recovery, I want to reiterate that our primary focus continues to be maximizing profitability for 2023 and beyond in a sustainable manner by prioritizing our long-term brand equity and protecting our industry-leading pricing. While the macroeconomic environment heading into 2023 remains more uncertain than usual, we see several tailwinds and catalysts to sustain our current positive trajectory as outlined on Slide 5. First, the public health regulatory COVID-related protocols continue to improve. In the past 30 to 45 days alone, key countries like Canada, Bermuda, Greece, and all of South America have removed COVID testing requirements for entry, and many countries in Asia have begun reopening to cruise. These developments have paved the way for us to relax our own COVID-19 protocols, allowing us to reach a wider cruising population, as well as adding greater variety to high-yielding itineraries as more ports around the world become accessible to cruising. With the public health environment improving, in September, our three brands removed mandatory vaccination requirements. And just last month, Norwegian Cruise Line took another significant step forward with the elimination of all COVID-19-related guest protocols. That means no more vaccination, testing, or masking requirements on any of the line's 18 ships except in the very few areas around the world which still have specific COVID rules. This is a long-awaited alignment of protocols to the rest of the travel, leisure, and hospitality industries, which reduces friction, eliminates the No. 1 reason for not booking a cruise, and meaningfully enhances the cruise experience for our guests. Our SailSAFE program was always designed to evolve. And the improvement in a public health environment, along with the near elimination of intrusive protocols to remain in place, allow us to uphold our No.1 priority of protecting the health, safety, and well-being of our guests, crew, and the communities we visit. Second, while there are heightened concerns surrounding an economic slowdown in the broader marketplace, the primary target cohort of our three brands, which is more upmarket and affluent than that of the cruise industry as a whole, continues to demonstrate a willingness to spend on travel and experiences. In fact, you may have heard commentary from credit card issuers this earnings season about continued strong spend on travel and experiences, especially by those in higher-income categories, reinforcing the continued strength and resilience of demand for cruising, particularly among Americans. Within the cruise industry, we believe our company is well positioned to outperform if indeed the macroeconomic environment weakens. First, and as Slide 6 illustrates, our dominance in the upscale space which we participate in, not only through our Oceania and Regent brands, but also with our exclusive high-end ship-within-a-ship concept on Norwegian with The Haven is significant. And while this quarter is not totally immune to economic downturns, it has been very resilient historically. In addition, Slide 6 also demonstrates our favorable guest demographic mix, which skews toward the higher end of the income spectrum as each of our brands operate at the top of their respective industry categories. The vast majority of our guests have a net worth of 250,000-plus, again, a more resilient cohort in the event of an economic downturn, particularly if the job market remains strong and the equity markets stabilize. With over 85% of our guests sourcing coming from North America, we will also benefit in the near term given our relatively low exposure to European sourcing where the economic environment is already challenged. Long term, this bodes well for our business as North Americans have historically been the guests who book the earliest, garner the highest ticket price, and spend the most on board. Taken together, these factors contribute to our strong book position despite current macroeconomic worries and a turbulent geopolitical environment. Last quarter, we spoke about the two indicators in our business that we typically monitor to evaluate the extent and willingness of consumers to spend on cruise travel: the first being the booking window, which provides a peek into the consumer's psyche about the future; and the second being our onboard revenue generation, which is our best real-time now indicator. Both of these indicators continue to meet or exceed our expectations. In fact, our onboard revenue generation continues to break records as onboard revenue -- revenue per passenger cruise day was approximately 30% higher than the comparable 2019 period. In addition, our booking window in the third quarter was approximately 245 days, nearly 10% ahead of the same quarter in 2019. This is important because an elongated booking window is preferable as it provides better visibility, which allows us to increase prices sooner while moderating marketing spend. The last catalyst I want to touch on is our industry-leading newbuild pipeline outlined on Slide 7, which we expect will enhance our brands' profile and product offerings and, most importantly, drive significant revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share, and cash flow growth. Turning to Slide 8, in August, we celebrate the christening of our newest ship, Norwegian Prima in the Reykjavik -- in Reykjavik, Iceland, the first major cruise ship christened in this historic seafaring locale. Prima has been incredibly well received with extremely positive feedback from the guests, travel partners, media, and the investment community who have participated in the ship's sailings so far. The addition of Prima and her upcoming five sister ships, along with Oceania Cruises' new generation of Vista Class ships and Regent's Seven Seas Grandeur, will, without a doubt, reinforce the positioning of our brands as the leaders in providing upscale experiences in each of the major cruise categories. Looking ahead to 2023, we have three new builds, one for each brand entering the fleet with over 5,000 additional berths. These new ships are expected to attract new-to-brand guests, create excitement for our loyal past guests, and contribute significantly to top- and bottom-line financial results. With the relatively small size of our current 29-ship fleet, we are confident that we can absorb this capacity growth. Not only do we have many unserved and underserved markets around the world, but we also continue to believe that the cruise industry at large is vastly under-penetrated, especially when measured against other land-based vacation alternatives. To put this point into perspective, as you can see on Slide 9, which we provided at our investor event last month, the total number of staterooms aboard our 29 ships across our three brands is less than one-fourth the total number of hotel rooms in Orlando, Florida, alone, just one city and one single country. And even if you look at the entire cruise industry, there are fewer staterooms in the global cruise fleet of over 250 ships than there are hotel rooms in the top three U.S. cities for hotel capacity, which is Orlando, Las Vegas, and Chicago. So, the opportunity to grow demand is significant. And when you couple that with the supply side of the equation, where we have a high degree of visibility and a limited pipeline of new ships due to shipyard constraints, the industry, and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, in particular, have a strong foundation for continued growth. Shifting our discussions now to our booking demand and pricing trends. As you can see on Slide 10, in the third quarter, our load factor was approximately 82%, in line with our guidance and demonstrating continued and substantial improvement over the prior quarter of 65%. We expect load factors to continue improving sequentially to the mid to high 80% range in the fourth quarter despite the fourth quarter historically being a seasonally lower-occupancy quarter in the third quarter. And looking at our quarterly load factor in terms of the gap with 2019, third quarter occupancy was approximately 30% below the comparable 2019 period. And we expect continued sequential improvement in closing this gap to about 20% during the fourth quarter. The steady occupancy ramp-up is expected to continue until we reach historical 100%-plus levels beginning in the second quarter of 2023. In terms of pricing, as you can see on Slide 11, our net per diem price growth in the third quarter of '22 when compared to the third quarter of 2019 was up approximately 5%. This is particularly impressive when considering the hit pricing took with the absence of premium-priced Baltic itineraries in the quarter due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. These strong results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy of holding firm on our core go-to-market strategy of market-to-fill versus discounted sale and maintaining price integrity by emphasizing high value over low price, which you can see on Slide 12. I've said this before, and I will reiterate again today given its high importance, that we strongly believe that this strategy is the optimal path to continually deliver high-quality and sustainable profitability once we return to a fully normalized post-pandemic environment, which, again, we expect will be in the early second quarter of 2023. Turning to Slide 13, as expected, our fourth quarter 2022 book position remains below that of 2019. That said, pricing continues to be significantly higher when compared to 2019 even when taking into consideration the dilutive effect of future cruise credits. Dilution from future cruise credits will not carry forward into 2023 as the bonus or value-add portion of certificates issued during the pandemic will expire at year-end. Focusing in on 2023, our full-year book position is equal to 2019's record performance, and our ongoing net booking pace is at the level needed to sail full beginning in the second quarter of 2023. We believe our cumulative book position is at the optimal level when balancing our desire to encourage guests to book early in order to be approximately 65% booked by year-end for the following year while also maximizing our industry-leading pricing so as not to leave yield on the table. This volume versus price dynamic is a delicate balance that we have fine-tuned over the years using historical itinerary-specific data and our sophisticated revenue management system and is key to our success. Pricing is also significantly higher for 2023 versus the comparable 2019 period with strength seen across all three brands. As we have said previously, pricing, naturally, will level off as we fill out our book for 2023, but we continue to expect to achieve record pricing for full-year 2023. As we look to the future, our entire team is mobilized, energized, and ready to flawlessly execute. Our eyes are wide open, and we are preparing for multiple scenarios given the current heightened uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, and we are ready to adapt and pivot if needed. Our company and our industry has demonstrated its resilience time and again in the past, and I'm confident that, if necessary, we will do so again. We are also encouraged by the relaxation of protocols and the regulatory and public health environment which paved the way for us to return to normal operations. And we are excited to welcome the eight additional ships to our fleet we have on order through 2027. We will continue to be disciplined and strategic as we work to set our company up for long-term success and to maximize value for all stakeholders. I'll be back with closing comments a little later, but for now, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his commentary on our financial position. Mark. ","Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our third-quarter financial results and outlook and the progress we continue to make on our path to full recovery. Slide 14 outlines key metrics highlighting our third-quarter results, all of which were at or above our previous guidance. During the quarter, our load factor improved 17 points over the prior quarter to 82%, in line with the guidance previously provided. This is consistent with our phased and methodical approach to ramping up occupancies while maintaining pricing discipline as we remain on track to reach historical load factor levels for the second quarter of 2023. Fourth-quarter load factor is expected to be in the mid to high 80% range, which, while on the surface appears only modestly higher than third quarter, represents continued significant improvement when taking into account the seasonality of our operations. Strong ticket pricing and onboard revenue generation drove total revenue per passenger cruise day in the quarter, up approximately 14% versus 2019, better than our expectation for a high single-digit increase. This is particularly impressive given the impact in 2022 of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on premium-priced Baltic itineraries, which are heavily weighted to this quarter. In addition, crew-related capacity constraints on the high-yielding Pride of America were another headwind during the quarter. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect this metric to increase by approximately 20% compared to 2019 levels. Slide 15 illustrates our advanced ticket sales build, which continues to indicate healthy consumer demand. Our total ATS balance stood at 2.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, flat versus the prior quarter's record-high balance and versus the seasonal decline we typically see between the second and third quarter. On a gross basis, ATS build was 1.5 billion, consistent with the prior quarter, which was the highest level in three years. In addition, approximately 1.6 billion of the total ATS balance at quarter end is associated with bookings that are already within the final payment window and, therefore, subject to cancellation penalties, which, by definition, results in stickier bookings and lower risk of churn. Turning to cost, we continue to feel the impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints, which is pressuring margins in the near term. As seen on Slide 16, we have opportunistically added to our fuel hedge position during the quarter and are now approximately 44% hedged for the remainder of '22 and approximately 38% hedged for 2023. We continue to expect adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day to decrease approximately 10% in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half. Given our ongoing ramp-up, second-half costs are not representative of a go-forward run rate, in part due to the additional demand-generating marketing investments as we lay the foundation for 2023, which we expect will normalize closer to historical levels on a capacity-adjusted basis beginning next year. In addition, we're starting to see some moderation of the hyperinflation we have seen in late areas -- of late in areas such as food costs and related. Looking ahead to 2023, net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day will exceed 2019 levels, as anticipated, due to both normal and hyperinflation over the past three to four years. However, we are laser-focused on managing our cost base, and our entire team is focused on mitigating this impact by increasing efficiencies and rightsizing the business, all while still preserving the exceptional guest experience our brands are known for. To help with modeling, we have also provided additional guidance on key metrics like capacity days, revenue expectations, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, fuel consumption, and capital expenditures, all which can be found on Slide 17 and in our earnings release. Shifting to our financial performance. Slide 18 demonstrates our continued momentum and consistency in achieving key milestones. Last quarter, we generated operating cash flow for the first full quarter since the beginning of the pandemic. And this quarter, we are pleased to report positive adjusted EBITDA of approximately 28 million. The next step forward is our expectation to achieve adjusted free cash flow in the fourth quarter. We have been clear throughout our return to service that this will not be an overnight flip-the-switch process, particularly given our intense focus on best positioning our company to maximize profitability once we return to a fully normalized operating environment. On our current trajectory, each of these building blocks are expected to lead to record net yields and record adjusted EBITDA for the full-year 2023. Moving to liquidity and our balance sheet on Slide 19, our overall liquidity position remains strong, totaling approximately 2.2 billion at quarter end, consisting of cash of approximately 1.2 billion and the undrawn 1 billion commitment. Keep in mind that during the third quarter, we took delivery of Norwegian Prima, which resulted in a cash outlay partially offset by incremental ECA ship financing. Based on our current projections and trajectory, we continue to believe we will be able to meet our liquidity needs organically. Slide 20 demonstrates the result of our deliberate measures throughout the pandemic to optimize our debt maturity profile, which positions us well as we ramp up to a normal operating environment. For the remainder of 2022 and for the full-year '23, we have approximately 300 million and 1 billion of debt payments coming due, respectively, the vast majority of which are related to our low-cost export-credit-agency-backed ship financing. We have previously disclosed that we are in the process of extending our operating credit facility consisting of our revolver and Term Loan A, which mature in early 2024, and we are on track to complete this by year-end. Upon completion, we expect to have a relatively smooth maturity profile over the course of the next few years. For additional detail on the breakdown of upcoming debt payments through 2027, we provide a detailed schedule on our investor relations website. Our total debt portfolio is approximately 75% fixed rate today, and this is expected to increase to approximately 80% by year-end 2023, with the addition of three new builds next year, which positions us well in a rising rate environment. Turning to Slide 21. In addition to maximizing our current fleet, our expected future earnings growth from today's normalized levels will be fueled by the transformational growth profile we already have in the pipeline, representing a 50% growth in capacity versus 2019 levels. As Frank touched on, we welcome this new capacity given our company and, more broadly, the cruise industry's under-penetration within the larger leisure landscape. Our new ships have a very favorable and efficient financing structure locked in at the time of contract, which results in an expected immediate boost to profitability once they enter service. For all newbuilds on order, our -- our financing is committed at fixed rates averaging approximately 2.5% over the portfolio. Another important component of our newbuild pipeline is that, well, prior to a ship delivery, we are already receiving significant cash flows in the form of advance ticket sales and pre-sale of onboard revenue streams. This typically equates to roughly 100 million to 150 million of cash inflow from future bookings prior to a vessel's first revenue sailing, essentially resulting in a cash infusion into the business that continues to build over time as final payments for future voyages also become due. Before handing the call back to Frank, I want to reiterate that while we are proud of the tremendous progress we have made to date, we are not taking our foot off the gas and are relentlessly focused on executing our medium- and long-term financial strategy as laid out on Slide 22. We are keeping a close watch on the macroeconomic environment and are preparing to adapt to any potential scenario. But we are confident we are taking the right steps to set up our company for a successful future. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Frank for closing comments.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) Q2 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 09, 2022","Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Over the past several quarters, we have reached many pivotal milestones as we continue the steady march of our post-pandemic recovery. On our last call, we had just welcomed the last ship in our fleet back to service, becoming the first major cruise operator to be fully operational. This quarter, we are pleased to report that we have reached another key milestone with operating cash flow turning positive for the second quarter. While our focus is on our profitable future, when I take a moment to reflect on the tremendous progress we have made since launching our Great Cruise Comeback just over a year ago, I can't help but be immensely proud of the entire team in Norwegian for rising to the occasion time and again and delivering impressive results. Working well alongside us has been the travel agent community who more than anyone can appreciate the challenges that we as an industry have overcome, and more importantly, can also see the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead. We thank them for their unyielding support throughout this journey. We have been disciplined and methodical in our ramp-up and have maintained a clear and consistent mindset focused on our core market strategy of market to fill and emphasizing value over price by continuing to expand and refine our bundling strategy. Our guiding principle has been a focus on the long-term profitability of the company, particularly for 2023 and beyond, by protecting our long-term brand equity and building on our industry-leading pricing. This means making intentional tactical sacrifices in the short term in favor of long-term sustainable results. With this ethos at the forefront of our business plan, we also continue to be opportunistic, exploring all options to accelerate our recovery. As I serve in the current landscape, I see several tailwinds and catalysts for our company, which are outlined on slide four. First, since we last spoke, we have seen further improvement in the public health and regulatory environments, which has allowed us to relax COVID-related protocols and align us more to the rest of the hospitality industry. Last month, the CDC discontinued its voluntary COVID-19 program for cruise ships. This was a strong signal of confidence by the CDC that the industry's COVID-19 mitigation and management plans are robust and effective. This very positive development has paved the way for us to begin removing barriers for our guests. We're committed by local regulations, bringing us not quite an equal footing with land-based vacation and leisure alternatives, but significantly closer. Just yesterday, we announced a number of changes to our own health and safety protocols, which are effective September 3, and as always, are subject to local regulations. We will no longer have a mandatory vaccination requirement in any of our ships and have relaxed testing protocols regardless of sailing length. To put it simply, vaccinated individuals, including those embarking on NCLH ships from U.S. ports, will no longer have any pre-cruise-related protocols. And those who are unvaccinated or choose not to provide proof of vaccination will be required to test negative within 72 hours prior to embarkation. In addition, all guests 11 years old and younger will be exempt from vaccination and testing requirements of any kind. There remain a few jurisdictions with strict requirements, including Canada, Greece, and Bermuda where we will continue to comply with local mandates. These modifications or protocols are meaningful and give us additional flexibility to reach a wider cruising population, reduce friction and travel-related hassles for our guests and bring greater variety to our itineraries. In fact, yesterday's announcement was an instant catalyst, resulting in one of our top three best booking days of the year. Our top priority remains the health, safety and well-being of our guests, crew and communities we visit. And this commitment to -- is unwavering even as we are evolving our SailSAFE protocols to adapt to the changing public health environment. Across the globe, we continue to see the easing of travel restrictions and reopening of ports to cruise, bringing us closer to a normal operating environment. One significant example of this easing is the lifting in June of the onerous one-day testing requirement to enter the U.S. While the decision was too late to have a meaningful impact on ship sailing in a second, and to a lesser degree, third quarters of this year. The change resulted in an immediate and sustained boost in booking volumes for future periods in the weeks following the announcement. Second, and despite recession and economic slowdown fears abounding in the broad marketplace, we continue to see a strong upmarket consumer, with booking trends continuing to show steady improvement week-over-week, which I will touch on in more detail later in the call. But at a high level, to evaluate the extent and willingness of consumers to spend on cruise travel, we typically monitor two key indicators. First is the booking window, which provides a peek into the consumer psyche about the future, given that cruise is a long lead time and relatively high ticket purchase. To be clear, we have not seen any cracks emerge in the dynamics of the booking window. And it remains both within historical range and our own expectations. Second is our onboard revenue generation, which is a real-time now indicator of how our guests are feeling about their financial situation right now and while onboard our ships. Onboard revenue generation has continued to be impressive, even as we continue to ramp up occupancy carrying more guests across all ships and cabin classes. In the second quarter, onboard revenue per passenger cruise day was approximately 30% higher than during the comparable 2019 period. We continue to focus on enhancing our market-leading bundled offerings and increasing quality touch points with our guests starting from the time of booking to capture even more revenue pre-cruise, allowing guests to arrive on board with an ever fresher wallet, which ultimately results in higher overall spend. In fact, our pre-cruise revenue on a per passenger day basis for second quarter '22 is up over 50% versus 2019 levels. At a high level, guests who make pre-cruise purchases tend to spend approximately double that of guests who do not pre-book onboard activities. And while the broader economy has experienced a pullback in consumer spending for physical goods, we continue to see strong propensity for spending on travel and experiences, particularly from the affluent consumer. Hotel average daily rates and airline fares remain at or near record levels, with occupancies reaching pandemic peaks. Consumers want a vacation even during economic downturns. And we believe cruises are much better positioned than land-based alternatives to capture the strong demand given our unmatched value proposition. While consumer appetite for experiences bodes well to the entire cruise industry, we believe our company in particular is best positioned to outperform in this environment. Our three brands focus on providing upscale experiences relative to their respective industry categories, and therefore, skewed toward the higher-end consumer, which while not immune, have proven more resilient than other cohorts in previous downturns. And all indications are that the intent to travel for this demographic has not abated. The last and arguably most exciting catalyst I want to touch on is our attractive pipeline of new builds, outlined on slide five, which will greatly enhance our already world-class fleet and drive significant contributions to the top and bottom line. I just came back from Italy last week where we took delivery of Norwegian Prima, the first of six next-generation Norwegian Cruise Line ships, bringing our total fleet to 29 vessels with approximately 62,000 berths. We are excited to celebrate her christening ceremony later this month in Reykjavik, Iceland. And I encourage all of you to experience her firsthand as she is truly incredible. In fact, our shipbuilding partners, Fincantieri, has said Prima is the clients' most demanding and most complex vessel they have ever built. The Prima Class marks an evolution for Norwegian Cruise Line as every aspect of the design and guests' experience has been elevated. Last week, we also celebrate the float-out Norwegian Viva, the second vessel in this groundbreaking new class, which is expected to debut in summer of 2023, as seen on slide six. The Prima Class will further differentiate Norwegian Cruise Lines compared to our cruise peers and reinforce the positioning of our brands as the leaders in providing upscale experiences in each of the major cruise categories. In addition to the new Norwegian vessels, we are also gearing up for the delivery of Oceania Vista in spring of '23 and Regent Seven Seas Grandeur later that year. These new additions will further add to our dominance in the flourishing upper premium and luxury segments. I often get asked whether we are confident that we can profitably absorb the capacity growth we are expecting for the next few years. And the answer is a resounding yes. Given our relatively small base of only 29 ships, we still have many unserved and underserved markets around the world. We are continually innovating and enhancing our product offerings through our new builds and refurbishment upgrades to our existing fleet and making enhancements to our bundled offering to provide even more value and attract even more high-paying guests to our brands. I can't emphasize this enough. So I will show you once again on slide seven, how we've proven our ability over the years to absorb capacity and deliver outsized revenue, adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow contributions relative to our capacity growth, and we fully expect to continue this trend. Turning now to our booking demand and pricing trends summarized on slide eight. We continue to see sequential improvement as we remain disciplined and focused on laying the foundation for a record 2023 and beyond. In the second quarter, our load factor was approximately 65%, in line with our expectations and a significant improvement versus the prior quarter of 48%. We expect load factors to increase to the low 80% range in the third quarter, with July already coming in at 85%. This steady sequential ramp is expected to continue until we reach historical 100%-plus levels beginning for the second quarter of 2023. In terms of pricing, as you can see on slide nine, our net per diem growth in the first half of 2022 over the first half of 2019 pricing was significant at 18%. These results are consistent with our strategy of holding firm on our go-to-market strategy, outlined on slide 10, of market to fill versus discount to fill and maintaining pricing integrity by emphasizing high value over low price. We absolutely believe this is the optimal path to continually deliver high-quality and sustainable profitability once we return to a fully normalized environment post-pandemic. As expected, our second half 2022 book position remains below, an extraordinarily strong 2019, driven primarily by the lasting impacts of Omicron and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. That said, pricing for the second half of 2022 continues to be higher when compared to 2019, even when taking into consideration of the dilutive effect of future cruise credits and the impact of premium priced Baltic itineraries from the Ukraine conflict, which is primarily concentrated in the third quarter. As we move beyond this transition year and focus on 2023, our full year book position is in line with 2019's record performance. And our booking pace in recent weeks has reached the level needed to consistently sail full. Pricing is also significantly higher for 2023. And while we typically would not provide this level of detail, our performance in this area is so extraordinary that I just had to share it with you this one time. Pricing for 2023 is currently running in excess of 20% above 2019's record pricing and is higher by double digits across all three brands. And while pricing will naturally tend to level off as we continue to build our book for 2023, it is nevertheless a testament that our steadfast strategy of focusing on long-term price increases over short-term load factors is indeed working as intended. Another onetime proof point that I will provide is ticket sales already on the books for 2023 sailings. When compared to the same time in 2018 for 2019 sailings and taking into account capacity growth of approximately 20%, 2023 sales are a whopping 40% higher. In addition, the quality and stickiness of our ticket sales for '23 sailings is also expected to improve, as a significantly higher proportion of bookings, four times the level seen in 2019, include air travel booked through our own air program, which in the past has proven to be indeed stickier. Another positive indicator demonstrating strong consumer demand is our advanced ticket sales bill. As you can see on slide 11, our advanced ticket sales balance stood at $2.5 billion as of the end of the second quarter, up over $300 million versus the prior quarter despite approximately $1 billion of revenue recognized. This represents an all-time record-high ATS balance for the company. On a gross basis, advanced ticket sales build increased by over 40% to $1.5 billion in the quarter, the highest level in three years. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of the total ATS balance at quarter end is associated with bookings that are already within the final payment window, and therefore, subject to cancellation penalties. The bottom line is that our entire team is more energized now than ever before. We are striving to reach our goal of record net yields and record adjusted EBITDA in 2023, welcoming eight additional ships to our fleet through 2027 after Prima this year and leveraging all opportunities to maximize value for our stakeholders. This will not be an easy feat, especially as we continue to navigate an uncertain macroeconomic, but an increasingly encouraging public health and regulatory environment. We are prepared for all scenarios. And I'm confident that we are taking the right steps today to set us up for future success. I'll be back with closing comments a little later. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his commentary on our financial position. Mark? ","Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my commentary on our financial results and outlook, I would be remiss if I did not take a moment to thank our team of nearly 35,000 team members across the globe for their continued dedication, passion and commitment to excellence. Their collective efforts are propelling us forward as we continue to execute on our operational and financial recovery plan. We have made tremendous progress to date, which has led to the significant financial inflection point of generating positive operating cash flow in the quarter for the first time since the start of the pandemic. Turning to our second quarter results. During the quarter, we returned our full fleet back to service with the relaunch of Norwegian Spirit in early May. Our load factor for the quarter was 65%, in line with our prior guidance, which reflects our methodical approach to ramping up occupancy while maximizing pricing. Numerous sailings across key regions and markets achieved over 90% and 100% occupancy, with particular strength in recent months in the Caribbean and Bermuda markets. We continue to expect sequential quarterly increases in occupancies, with load factors returning to historical levels for the second quarter of 2023. Strong ticket pricing and onboard revenue generation drove total revenue per passenger cruise day in the quarter up approximately 20% versus 2019. As we look to the third quarter, we expect this metric to increase by high single digits compared to 2019 levels. This is impressive considering the impact in 2022 of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on premium-priced European, in particular, Baltic, itineraries, which are heavily weighted to the third quarter. As a reminder, three ships were redeployed entirely as a result of the conflict, including one for each brand, and a total of 60 sailings across our fleet were canceled or modified. In addition, crew-related capacity constraints on the high-yielding Pride of America are a further headwind to overcome. Turning to costs. Like every company across the globe, we continue to experience pressures from inflation and global supply chain constraints. Fuel prices remain a headwind, but our hedge program, as seen on slide 12, provides partial protection. And more recently, we have also seen prices beginning to moderate. We have opportunistically added to our hedge position during the quarter and are now approximately 40% hedged for the remainder of '22 and approximately 30% for 2023. We are also experiencing pressure on food costs, although we have recently seen green shoots, prices moderating for certain commodities, such as beef and pork. In addition, we are starting to see shipping and logistical costs moderating from their highs experienced in 2021 and early '22. Our supply chain and logistics teams continue to work around the clock to find measures to minimize this impact. Lastly, in the first half of 2022, we continued to incur additional costs associated with our COVID-19 health and safety protocols, primarily related to testing. As the industry continues to align its protocols with the broader travel and leisure space, we expect these costs to ramp down in the future. Taken together, we expect adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day, to decrease approximately 10% in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half. Guided by our core market to fill strategy, we will continue to make disciplined demand-generating investments in marketing in the near term, with a focus on laying the foundation for a strong 2023. Looking ahead, while it is still too early to provide concrete guidance, we expect net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity day, in 2023 to exceed 2019 levels. Aside from the fact of three or four years of both normal and now hyperinflation, remember that we have the youngest fleet of the major operators. We have not disposed of any ships during the pandemic, and therefore, will not receive the unit cost benefit from the removal of less efficient capacity. To help with modeling, we have also provided additional guidance on key metrics, like capacity days, revenue expectations depreciation and amortization, interest expense, fuel consumption and capital expenditures. All of which can be found on slide 13. Shifting to our financial performance. Slide 14 lays out the key financial milestones already achieved, as well as our expectations for the upcoming quarters. As previously stated, we generated approximately $260 million of operating cash flow for the second quarter after first turning positive for the month of March. Given that just over a year ago, we were just beginning the herculean task of returning our ships to service after 500 days on the sidelines, this is no small accomplishment. The next milestone we are aiming to achieve is slightly positive adjusted EBITDA for the second half of 2022, leading to positive adjusted free cash flow for the fourth quarter. All of these stepping stones are consistent with our return to service plan and position us extremely well for 2023, where a return to a more normal operating environment, along with our focus on pricing discipline, is expected to lead to record net yields and record adjusted EBITDA for the full year. Moving to liquidity and our balance sheet. Our overall liquidity position remains strong, totaling approximately $2.9 billion at quarter end, which consisted of cash of approximately $1.9 billion and an undrawn $1 billion commitment. This existing $1 billion commitment, originally entered into in November 2021, was recently extended through March 2023. We have been clear that we view this facility as a backstop, and we currently do not intend to draw on it. However, given the volatility in the capital markets in recent months, we felt extending the facility was the prudent choice to enhance our financial flexibility. Based on our current projections and trajectory, we continue to believe we will be able to meet our liquidity needs organically. Slide 15 demonstrates the result of the proactive and deliberate measures we undertook throughout the pandemic to optimize our debt maturity profile. We resumed debt amortization payments in April, which were previously deferred during the pandemic. For the remainder of 2022 and for full year 2023, we have approximately $500 million and $900 million of debt payments coming due, respectively. The vast majority of which is related to our export credit agency-backed ship financing. While on the surface, 2024 maturities appear high, approximately $2.4 billion is related to our operating credit facility, consisting of our revolver and term loan A. Both of which we expect to refinance well prior to maturity. This positions us well as we continue to ramp up and return to a more normal operating environment. For additional detail on the breakdown of our upcoming debt payments through 2027, we also provide a detailed schedule on our investor relations website. After taking delivery of Prima less than two weeks ago, with fixed rate financing that was secured back in 2017, our debt portfolio is approximately 75% fixed rate today. This fixed rate -- fixed ratio is expected to increase to approximately 80% by year-end 2023, with the addition of three new builds next year, positioning us well in a rising rate environment. The weighted average cost of debt for the portfolio is approximately 5%. We took out, as a reminder, all of the high-cost double-digit debt we incurred during the pandemic at an opportune time prior to the current dislocation we are seeing in the markets by completing balance sheet optimization transactions in November '21 and February 2022. Turning to slide 16. As I've said this before and will repeat it today, we believe the transformational growth we have in the pipeline over the next few years, representing 50% growth in capacity by 2027 as compared to 2019, is an underappreciated component of our company's investment thesis. Our new ships have very favorable and efficient financing structures, resulting in an expected and immediate boost to profitability. For all new builds on order, our financing is committed at fixed rates averaging approximately 2.5% over the portfolio. To help you better understand the mechanics of the cash inflows and outflows associated with the new ship, slide 17 lays out an illustrative scenario demonstrating the typical timeline. In general, approximately 20% of the ships cost is due in four installments tied to various milestones preconstruction beginning at contract signing. Typically, 80% of the cost is then due upon taking delivery of the ship. However, while this looks like a large capital expenditure outlay in the financial statements, we also received very efficient export credit agency-backed financing at the same time. This ECA-backed financing covers approximately 80% of the ship cost, which, as I mentioned earlier, is committed prior to contract signing and at extremely attractive rates. In certain cases, we also structure predelivery financing in order to better map the timing of cash flows. Amortization payments on this deck began six months after delivery of each vessel and continue over 12 years. An often overlooked but incredibly important facet in the cash flow mechanics of a new build timeline is that well prior to a delivery of a vessel, we are already receiving significant cash inflows in the form of advanced ticket sales and onboard presales. Given that final payments from our guests are typically due 120 days prior to a sailing, this is when the cash engine begins to come to life. As a rough estimate, we typically receive in the range of $100 million to $150 million of cash inflow from future bookings prior to a vessel's first revenue sailing, resulting in a cash infusion into the business that continues to build over time as final payments for future voyages also become due. So while we often hear concerns surrounding the industry's capacity growth, we welcome and are excited for new capacity we have coming online. We have a high degree of visibility into the supply chain, supply pipeline for the industry, with only four major shipyards globally who can build cruise ships of scale. This, coupled with the incredibly efficient cost and financing structure of the new builds are a unique differentiator for us and the industry at large. So in summary, I am pleased with the progress we have made so far, but more importantly, how we have positioned our company for the future. While there continue to be challenges facing our business and we are keeping a close eye on how the macroeconomic environment evolves, we also have significant tailwinds, including a continued post-pandemic return to normalcy and the industry-leading capacity growth that I just discussed. All of which bode well for our future prospects. With that, I'll turn it back over to Frank for closing comments.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) Q1 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 10, 2022","Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In the last few days, our company marked a significant milestone, if not the most significant milestone thus far in our Great Cruise Comeback. This past Saturday, Norwegian Spirit welcomed guests for the first time since our fleetwide pause in operations back in March of 2020. And in doing so, she became the final ship in our 28-ship fleet to return to service, making Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings the first major cruise operators that have all its ships operating again. The last two years and certainly, the last few months have been challenging, to say the least. But with each new challenge in a row that further complicate an already colossal undertaking, the team at Norwegian stepped up to the plate time and again to demonstrate our extraordinary resilience, dedication and passion. So I want to thank each and every team member across our organization, from shipboard to shore side, for all their efforts to reach this point and our Great Cruise Comeback and position our company to thrive in the years to come. Even more impressive was our team's ability to drive some of the highest guest satisfaction scores ever, ticket revenue and onboard spend in our history, and this trend has persisted even as we ramp up occupancy, carrying more guests across all brands, all itineraries and in all cabin classes. We have reached this milestone with a clear, consistent and focused strategy throughout our relaunch, ensuring that we do not prioritize short-term gains at the expense of jeopardizing our long-term brand equity and industry-leading pricing in the process. First, we have prioritized the health, safety and well-being of our guests, crew and the communities we visit above all else, doing everything possible to create a safe and healthy experience for all stakeholders. Since launching our Great Cruise Comeback, we have carried over 500,000 guests, and we continue to experience significantly lower COVID incidence rates of aboard our ships as compared to the population at large, indicating that our health and safety protocols are indeed working as designed. Second, and throughout the pandemic, we provided steadfast support, both to our guests and travel partners, focusing on doing the right thing and demonstrating our willingness to go to great lengths to support them. And I don't think this commitment has gone unnoticed. I firmly believe that as we exit the pandemic, our three brands will be in better standing than ever before with these key partners, the travel public at large and with our key past guests. And lastly, we have stood firm on our core go-to-market strategy of marketing to fill and maintaining price integrity by emphasizing value over price. You have heard me say time and time again that we will not sacrifice our industry-leading pricing to temporarily bolster our load factors, and I continue to stand behind that philosophy. Pricing will be the primary driver to net yield growth. As we exit the pandemic and return to a normalized booking performance, this outperformance will be key. And given that consistent net yield growth is the single most important factor in maximizing high-quality and sustainable profitability, this is an area where we will not compromise our efforts. So while our first quarter load factors were somewhat tempered, our net per diem growth over first quarter of 2019 record pricing was, as shown on Slide 5, significant. A trade-off and an outcome that is much more meaningful for the company's long-term success. Now you don't have to take my word for it, our pre-pandemic track record of stellar net yield outperformance year after year speaks for itself. As you can see on Slide 6, in 2019, our net yields were better than our peers by somewhere between 20% to 40%. This historical outperformance, coupled with the strong pricing we are experiencing for all future periods are evidence that our strategy is a superior one and the best way to protect our brand's equity while driving long-term shareholder value. Taking a step back to serve the broader landscape, today, we find ourselves in a much more favorable public health regulatory and demand environment than when we last spoke a little over two months ago. We have witnessed a continued relaxation of COVID-related protocols across the globe from air travel to concerts and other indoor activities, and this time around, the cruise industry is an active participant. First, we are pleased that in late March, the CDC entirely removed its travel health notices for cruise, representing a significant step toward leveling the playing field between cruise and our land-based counterparts. In addition, the CDC continues to modify elements of its voluntary framework for cruise, relaxing certain requirements, the most recent of which includes reducing required vaccination thresholds from 95% to 90%, which further opens up the important family market to cruising. Second, as I mentioned earlier, we have seen an acceleration in the reopening of society to pre-pandemic normalcy, which bodes well for the travel and leisure sector overall. More ports around the world have opened to cruise and we have seen travel restrictions relax in many areas. And while there are still regions where discussions to reopen to cruise are ongoing, particularly certain countries in Asia, the good news is that we do not have ships sailing in those regions until fourth quarter, giving us additional time to monitor the situation, plan for various outcomes and be ready to adapt as needed. And lastly, we are seeing an explosive showing by consumers, particularly American consumers. Consumer spend is strong, snapping back and even exceeding where we left off in 2019. Gone are the days where the family budget was going to antibacterial wipes, hand sanitizer, delivery apps, stationary bikes and streaming services. Consumers today are spending to catch up on over two years of missed experiences. One example of this that we see every day is hotel ADRs and airline fares, which are at or near record levels. And now with our full fleet back up and running in our industry's overwhelming advantage in its value proposition over land-based options, we, along with the entire cruise industry, are well positioned to capitalize on this pent-up demand.,While the public health environment improved over the course of the quarter, the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict did cause additional disruptions across the world and to our business, as you can see on Slide 7. First and foremost, we continue to hope for a peaceful resolution, which minimizes further impact for those in the region. Our motto is family first and as such, we have focused on assisting our impacted shipboard and shoreside team members as best we can. We have activated our crew relief fund and are providing logistical communication and mental health support to affected team members. In addition, we also provided a sizable donation to Save the Children of Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund and invited partners, including guests, travel partners and team members to contribute as well. Prior to the conflict, approximately 10% of our annual capacity across our three brands was scheduled to sail in the Baltic region, with approximately 5% calling on St. Petersburg, Russia. We subsequently canceled or modified approximately 60 sailings, which included all calls to ports in Russia for 2022. And in a move that demonstrates one of the unique strengths of our industry, we quickly redeployed three ships scheduled to operate in the region to sail alternate itineraries. Oceania's Marina, Regent Seven Seas Mariner, will remain in Europe sailing British Isles and Northern European itineraries, respectively. Meanwhile, Norwegian Getaway was redeployed to Port Canaveral to take advantage of pent-up close and domestic demand, which despite the condensed booking window, has already meaningfully exceeded our occupancy expectations. And in a pre-emptive measure, our three brands will pause all calls to Russia from their 2023 and 2024 itineraries. While this is not an ideal scenario, we are once again demonstrating our ability to pivot as needed and respond to exogenous events. Now turning to Slide 8. We shift today's discussions to our broader booking and demand trends. Overall, we continue to experience sequentially improving underlying demand and robust pricing for all future periods. The Omicron surge in December and January did indeed impact net booking momentum, with the vast majority of cancellations concentrated for close-in sailings. The tide began to turn in mid-January, when net booking volumes began to show week-over-week improvement. As bookings regained momentum, we experienced another temporary setback with the emergence of the Russian-Ukraine conflict. This impact was also short lived and was mainly concentrated on the Baltic region, with some leakage to surrounding Mediterranean sailings with cancellations returning to pre-conflict levels by the end of the first quarter. Overall net booking volumes have continued to improve sequentially, returning to and recently surpassing pre-micron levels and currently at levels approaching the pace needed to consistently sail at historical pre-pandemic load factors. As a result of the impact from Omicron and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, second half 2022 book position is not below an extraordinarily strong 2019. As we look further out in the year, the picture improved sequentially with book position in the fourth quarter remaining in line with 2019. More importantly, cumulative full year 2023 book position is ahead of 2019 and ahead of pre-pandemic 2020 at a comparable point in the booking curve. On the all-important pricing front, as mentioned earlier, our go-to-market strategy of marketing to fill versus discounting to fill and emphasizing value over price is paying off in droves, with pricing meaningfully higher for all future periods when compared to the comparable pre-pandemic periods. This holds true even when including the dilutive impact of future cruise credits in 2022, which, as a reminder, will no longer be a headwind in 2023 as FCCs must be applied to sailings through year-end 2022. As the booking environment improves, we will continue our strategic marketing efforts in order to further stoke demand to obtain quality, high-priced and high-value bookings. With each month that goes by, our recovery trajectory becomes a little clearer. 2022 is no doubt a transition year. But as I look toward 2023, I'm excited by the full potential of the future holds. We are still operating in an uncertain environment. And if we've learned anything, it's that a return to normalcy will certainly not happen overnight and possibly not without additional bumps in the road. But with each passing day, I'm increasingly confident that we are reaching the milestones needed to propel us forward in this recovery. We are doing everything in our control to position us for sustained long-term success and we are laying the foundation needed to set the company up for an extremely strong year in 2023 and beyond. From where we sit today and without another black swan event derailing our plans, there is a reasonable and clear path to reach record net yields and record adjusted EBITDA levels in 2023, boosted by the introduction of four new ships across our three brands over the next 18 months, a goal our entire team is focused on achieving. As just mentioned, a key component to this future success will be our industry-leading growth profile, with nine new ships coming online across our three brands through 2027. The first of these ships, Norwegian Prima will join our fleet in just a few short months, as you can see on Slide 9. After a record sales debut in May of 2021, her booking volumes continue to be stellar and her pricing significantly outpacing our past new ship launches.,In March, we announced that pop icon Katy Perry will serves as godmother to Prima and will be the headline entertainer at her christening ceremony in Reykjavik, Iceland. This announcement garnered significant media coverage, further building on the excitement surrounding Prima and allowing us to reach a new-to-cruise audience. As we look to next year, 2023 will be the first year that each of our brands will be welcoming new capacity, the addition of Norwegian Viva, Oceania Cruise's Vista and Regent Seven Seas Grandeur to our fleet. These new hardware introductions are a meaningful driver, not only in net yield growth and overall profitability, but also in attracting new guests to our brands and reigniting loyal past guests to enjoy new and elevated experiences. Theyalso have historically had a significant halo effect in the rest of our fleet. Needless to say, I'm ready and eager to begin welcoming these additional premium capacity to our fleet, which we expect will be meaningful contributors to our top and bottom line financial results. I'll be back with closing comments a little later. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Mark Kempa for his commentary on our financial position. Mark? ","Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my commentary on our financial results and outlook, I would like to take a moment to express my sincere thanks to our truly top-notch team for the successful execution of our return to service plan. Their hard work, collaboration and innovative spirit are unmatched, and their efforts have been critical to getting us to the significant milestone, with all ships now officially back to revenue service. Turning to the first quarter results. Strong ticket pricing and onboard revenue spend drove positive contribution from the fleet that operated in the quarter despite headwinds we faced from the Omicron variant. During the quarter, we canceled approximately 60 sailings due to Omicron-related operational disruptions from additional travel restrictions, increased health and safety protocols and port closures. This impact, coupled with our focus on maintaining price integrity for the long term, resulted in slightly lower than anticipated load factors in the quarter. However, pricing remained robust in the quarter, and onboard spend per person per day continues to be up meaningfully versus record 2019 levels. Looking ahead, load factors are also improving sequentially each month, and we expect second quarter load factors to come in at approximately 65%. This will continue to build throughout the year, and we expect to reach historical load factor levels in the first half of 2023 and at record pricing, staying consistent with our go-to-market strategy and protecting the long-term pricing strength of our brands. In addition, we are experiencing an uptick in bookings for close-in sailings, which not only help organically boost near-term load factors but more importantly, are a positive indicator that consumer confidence is building as these bookings are typically within the cancellation penalty period. Turning to our financial performance. Slide 10 lays out our expectations for upcoming key financial milestones. In March, we reached a significant inflection point in our financial recovery, with operating cash flow turning slightly positive for the month ahead of our previous projections, which we expect will continue throughout the second quarter. This momentum should continue to gain steam as we progress through the year with both positive operating cash flow and positive adjusted EBITDA expected for the second half of 2022. This sets us up nicely to achieve our goal of record net yields and record adjusted EBITDA for full year 2023. Moving to Slide 11. Our cash balance for the quarter increased by approximately $390 million on a net basis to $2.1 billion. This reflects $1.1 billion of cash burn associated with operations, including interest and capital expenditures, partially offset by nearly $600 million of advanced ticket sale collections and other working capital changes. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was also boosted by an incremental $925 million associated with the balance sheet optimization transactions we executed in February. Our overall liquidity remains strong, standing at $3.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, which positions us well to manage the resumption of debt amortization and newbuild-related payments, which were deferred during the pandemic, the former of which resumed beginning last month. With all ships now sailing and cash generation increasing month after month, our current trajectory would indicate that we are confident we can fund our operations organically. A key component of this cash generation is our advanced ticket sales build, which continues to accelerate. As you can see on Slide 13, Total ATS balance stood at $2.2 billion as of the end of the first quarter, up over $400 million versus the prior quarter. On a gross basis, ATS build increased by 60% to $1.1 billion in the quarter, surpassing the $1 billion mark for the first time since the start of the pandemic and approaching pre-pandemic levels. This is another positive indicator demonstrating strong consumer demands for our brands. Turning to cash burn. Our monthly burn in the quarter was approximately $375 million, better than our guidance of $390 million despite some cost pressures from inflation and global supply chain constraints. This cash burn figure does not include cash inflows associated with current or future bookings, nor contributions from ships that have already resumed service. Moving to the balance sheet. As part of our financial recovery plan shown on Slide 14, our team is focused day in and day out on finding and seizing opportunities to optimize our balance sheet and maximize value for our shareholders. During the quarter, we raised approximately $2.1 billion through a series of debt transactions. Proceeds from these transactions were used to redeem the remaining outstanding balances of the high-cost 12.25% senior notes due 2024 and the 10.25% senior secured notes due 2026, which we incurred out of necessity at the peak of the pandemic. The remaining proceeds of approximately $925 million will be used to make principal and interest payments on scheduled debt amortization due in the short term. These transactions extended our debt maturity profile and released certain collateral and guarantees. The combined benefit of these transactions, coupled with those completed late last year as laid out on Slide 15, reduced our annual cash interest expense by approximately $75 million. As I've touched on in the last few quarters, consistent with what all other industries are also experiencing, inflation in global supply chain constraints continue to put upward pressure on our costs. Fuel prices have risen significantly, accelerated by the ongoing geopolitical unrest. While we are not immune to this spike in pricing, our hedge program, as shown on Slide 24, provides partial protection. On the labor front, we remain relatively better positioned than our land-based peers due to our long-term employment agreements, which provide for stable wage inflation and predictability in our operating cost structure. We've also provided incremental guidance on key certain metrics like depreciation and amortization, interest, fuel consumptions and capital expenditures, all of which can be found on Slide 25. Looking ahead, we are gearing up to deliver on our attractive newbuild program. This transformational growth is an underappreciated cornerstone of our company's investment thesis. Compared to 2019, the addition of -- to our fleet of nine new ships through 2027 results in a 50% capacity growth versus 2019, as shown on Slide 16. This also reflects the additions of both Norwegian Encore in late 2019 and Regent Seven Seas Splendor in early 2020. These new ships are expected to be top line and margin accretive and with very efficient financing structures, resulting in an expected immediate boost to our profitability. As we have showed you in the past, Slide 22 demonstrates how this management team has time and again generated outsized returns on incremental capacity, a trend we fully expect to continue in the future. Another area where we can drive additional value for our stakeholders is our multiyear strategy to capture additional share of the leisure wallet. Cruise vacations continue to offer a unique and incredible compelling value proposition for consumers versus land-based vacation alternatives. In the past, we have said that a cruise typically offers at least 20% to 30% better value than a similar land-based alternative. With the current inflationary backdrop, that gap has widened, making our value proposition even more compelling today than ever before. Without the same labor pressures on many of our land-based peers are facing, we can also provide a consistent and exceptional level of service to our guests as evidenced by our high guest satisfaction scores. These factors combined present another opportunity for us to both drive additional demand and increased prices. Stepping back and looking at the bigger long-term picture, I am optimistic not only because of the progress we have made so far in our recovery, but also by our future prospects. Each new milestone we reach is another stepping stone as we push forward in our recovery process. And as I touched on, we have several significant catalysts to generate value beyond simply targeting a return to our pre-pandemic performance. We are focused on controlling what we can control and finding new and innovative ways, however big or small, to improve each day. I am confident that our strong culture of operational and financial excellence and discipline, which served us well in the past and through the challenges of the pandemic, will serve us even more in the future. With that, I'll turn the call back to Frank for closing comments. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/10/norwegian-cruise-line-holdings-nclh-q1-2022-earnin/
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) Q4 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 24, 2022","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. And as always, I hope that all of you as well as your loved ones remain healthy and safe. Before going into my main commentary, I'd like to address the recent geopolitical issue, which escalated last night. The tense situation in Ukraine is regrettable. And our hopes are that the conflict ends quickly with minimal impact to the safety and welfare of those in the region. We are following the situation carefully as it impacts our voyages in the area. We have no vessels in the region until late May. And we will be updating guests on our plans and about affected itineraries as needed. We have quite a bit to share with you today, ranging from our resumption of operations to the impacts of the omicron surge to recent developments with the CDC. We'll also cover the booking and pricing landscape in our plans for the return to service of the balance of our fleet. So let's get started. It seems like just yesterday that we launched our Great Cruise Comeback in late July of '21 after 500 days of no cruise operations. In the 5 months that followed through the end of 2021, we safely carried over 230,000 happy guests around the globe, everywhere from Europe to Alaska and points in between, delivering the unique and upscale vacation experiences that only our three award-winning brands can provide. This is evidenced by our brands having achieved the highest customer satisfaction scores in our history and a reflection of the deep commitment from our crew members, who are as energized as ever to be back in the high seas serving our guests. In addition, onboard spend by guests during the quarter continued to exceed all expectations and reached all-time highs. And we delivered these unparalleled vacation experiences in the safest manner possible with protocols that are unmatched by any other area of the hospitality sector. I'll repeat once again that our No. 1 priority is and always will be the health and safety of our guests, crew, and the communities we serve. And that commitment has never been more evident than in a month since our return to service. With over 230,000 guests sailing on our vessels in 2021, our COVID positivity rate was minuscule and certainly a fraction of what has been the case in the population at large. Our science-backed protocols, centered on vaccination and preboarding testing, provide a safe vacation experience that is not duplicated anywhere in the world. Today, and because of the rapid decrease in prevalence and in severity, the prospective view of the pandemic is rapidly changing across the globe. Municipalities, cities, states, countries, schools, institutions of all kinds, and private businesses alike are all moderating protocols as the public health environment improves. In the past, protocols were usually pared back slowly and only when cases had receded. But we have seen many instances, Denmark and Iceland being one of the best and most recent examples, where protocols and restrictions have been moderated despite high or even increasing caseloads. This latest normal now takes into account the diminished severity of the virus and balances the extent of necessary protocols with the need to resume daily life. The confidence for society to take these actions is mainly due to the availability and widespread uptake of vaccines, new therapeutics, and broad immunity. And an NCL cruise ship is one of the few places in the world where you can be assured that at least 95% of the people around you are fully vaccinated. And we're pleased to report that the rapidly improving public health environment has allowed us also to follow the easing of COVID-related protocols occurring in broader society. You can see on the return-to-service plan on Slide 4, a new phase, returning to normal, that reflects those changes and advances. Our brands recently announced that effective March 1, masking for guests across our fleet will be optional while taking into account local guidelines, if any. Also, beginning March 1 and in conjunction with the new CDC guidelines, which I'll discuss in a moment, the Norwegian brand will begin allowing all guests under the age of 12 to sail on an ship fleetwide. These two steps greatly expand the addressable market for our largest and most family oriented brand by allowing families to travel together regardless of age and without the mandate of wearing a mask. This announcement was scheduled to provide plenty of time and opportunity for families to plan their summer vacations with us. And all this comes at a time when last week, we had the lowest number of positive pre-embarkation cases per 1,000 guests by far since launching service last July during the delta surge. Recently, we were happy to see significant regulatory progress being made as we received clarification from the CDC on updated protocols for sailing originating from the U.S. ports. Back in January, our three brands were the first in the industry to opt into the CDC's voluntary COVID-19 program for cruise ships operating in U.S. waters. When our brands first opted in, the program had not yet been finalized. However, last week, as protocols to the program were confirmed, our brands reaffirmed their commitment made in March and mid-January of opting into the program, demonstrating once again our industry-leading and unwavering dedication to health and safety with protocols that appropriately reflects the public health environment. The program our brands have opted into calls for at least 95% of vaccine-eligible guests and crew be vaccinated. Given the differences in demographics of our brands, a vaccination requirement will differ somewhat with Norwegian requiring guests aged 12 and over to be fully vaccinated while Oceania and Regent will continue to require all passengers to be fully vaccinated. Regardless, we will continue to require that 100% of crew across our fleet be fully vaccinated and are working toward having all crew members boosted by April 1. The new updated protocols also allow for mask wearing to be optional as is the case with more and more societal activities. All the industry has ever asked is to be treated the same as other areas of society. The CDC's new voluntary program is a positive step in that direction, which we expect will lead to further easing of protocols as the pandemic continues its retreat. In the meantime, we will continue to maintain best-in-class protocols centered on vaccinations and testing for the health and safety of all onboard and to offer guests the safest vacation experience possible. The resumption of service across our fleet was not without its challenges. As difficult an endeavor as it was to pause and find safe haven for our entire fleet back in the spring of 2020, it is even a greater feat to smoothly bring back the fleet into operation and to deliver the world-class level of hospitality and service our brands are known for. I want to thank team members across our organization, from shipboard to shoreside, for the hard work, dedication, and passion they displayed in returning our fleet to service. I also want to thank our loyal past and new-to-brand guests for entrusting us with what, for many, has been their first taste of travel since the pandemic began two years ago. And a special and heartfelt thanks to the travel agency community, who have weathered the pandemic like no other. We stuck together through the industry's toughest times and are now reengaged to bring us all back stronger than ever. And finally, a thanks to our shareholders, lenders, shipyard partners, and the broader financial community for your support and confidence in our company, supporting our growth story, and the opportunities that lie ahead. The story of the past quarter was obviously all about the omicron wave. Unfortunately, omicron did not pick the best of times to make its appearance. Just as we were experiencing a solid rebound in bookings during October and November after the delta wave began to wane and buoyed by a very successful Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotions, the impact of omicron began to appear in early December. First, a Norwegian vessel, whose itinerary featured multiple calls to South African port, had its operations paused as omicron quickly spread there and additional travel restrictions were imposed. Canceling targeted sailings on certain vessels operating in the Caribbean and South America during the quarter also became necessary as an addition to travel restrictions, ports began implementing difficult, sometimes onerous requirements for docking. Concurrently, booking volumes slowed and cancellation of existing bookings increased. While omicron did impact our business in the near term, primarily for close-in sailings in the first and second quarters, it did provide the opportunity to once again demonstrate our resilience as a company and as an industry. Our ethos throughout the pandemic has emphasized being nimble and ready to adapt. Our management team has maneuvered to what no other industry has ever had to do and has done a remarkable job doing so. The silver lining to this pandemic is that it has brought our team even closer together and fortified the strong collaborative culture we already enjoyed and that we truly believe is one of our competitive advantages. As we return to normalcy, that positive culture will only grow stronger. Now for some good news. The impact of omicron are waning week by week. While the short term has been impacted, the following points illustrate the strong underlying consumer demand that gives us confidence about the trajectory of our business in the future. First, of the guest cancellations that occurred during December and the January period, the majority were for sailings in the first and second quarters of 2022, demonstrating sustained consumer confidence in sailings further out. Second, beginning in mid-January, net booking volumes began improving and continue to do so and accelerate sequentially week over week. Third, booked position for each quarter in 2022 when compared to 2019 sequentially improved over the prior quarter. Fourth, despite the erosion in booked position due to the delta and omicron surges, as of today, second half 2022 booked position is in line with what was an extraordinarily strong 2019, while 2023, compared to pre-pandemic 2020, is in an even better position, in fact, a record booked position. Fifth, again, as of today, pricing for 2022 and 2023 sailings remained higher for the full year versus 2019 and pre-pandemic 2020, respectively, even when including the diluted effect of future cruise credits. Our core go-to-market principle of marketing to fill versus discount to fill is performing like a champ as we have not and will not chase short-term occupancy by sacrificing price, which only results in long-term and perhaps even permanent damage to brand equity as we have seen over the years in other situations. Sixth, despite sailing cancellations and slight changes in our return-to-service plans due to omicron, all of our vessels are expected to sail by early May and in time for the peak summer season. And lastly, we are seeing our largest and most important distribution channels coming back to full strength. Every day, we are seeing more and more business being booked by our travel partners in a shift which bodes well for the industry as the vibrant travel agent community is vital and amplifies the reach of our message to consumers, which translates into more and better bookings. I want everyone to recall that in the past, our industry was accustomed to successfully managing through bumps in the road. Whenever there was a natural or geopolitical or some other black swan-type event that impacted bookings, you could almost count like clockwork that after 8 to 10 weeks of quiet, booking patterns would rebound. We've seen this pattern occur twice already during the pandemic, once last spring after the initial variant ceded and vaccinations became prevalent and most recently, last fall, right after the delta surge began to wane. With the public still a bit shellshocked by the sudden emergency -- emergence and equally dramatic decline of omicron, what our business needs now is a few weeks of quiet with no new variants or surges for confidence to return and momentum to take hold. Our experts in the SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council, headed by Dr. Scott Gottlieb, believe we're at that point right now. So while omicron did indeed have an immediate but short-term impact on our business, it was an impact that simply shifted expectations and the timing of our recovery by about three months. That shift in timing is coinciding with the shift in societal attitudes that I mentioned earlier from avoiding the virus at all cost to living with it. It's something we really didn't see after the delta wave but is gaining more and more momentum post omicron. We are seeing more and more living of life. And we once again began hearing the term revenge travel being batted about. These shifts bode well for our company as vacationers look to once again explore the world but to do so in a safe manner. I'll be back shortly with closing comments. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his commentary and the progress of our financial action plan. Mark? ","Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Frank and I for our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings and business update call. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which I will follow to discuss our financials before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at nclhltd.com/investors. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and the presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we begin, I would like to cover a few items.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NCLH) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 3, 2021","Thank you Jessica. And good morning everyone. And thank you for joining us today. And as always, I hope that all of you, as well as your loved ones, remain healthy and safe. Today, we will discuss commentary on three areas. First, the progress we have made on our great cruise come back. Second, our recent booking and demand trends, which have shown particular strength for sailings operating in second half of 2022 and for all of 2023, when our fleet is expected to be back in full operation in its normalized occupancy levels. And finally, on our exciting pipeline of new vessels, which we expect to contribute outsized EBITDA growth and other important financial metric improvements. Slide 4 outlines how far we have come on our return to service plan. When we last spoke in early August, we had just relaunched the first vessel in our fleet, Norwegian Jade in Greece, and we're on the verge of resuming cruising in the U.S., with Norwegian Encore making our West Coast debut, sailing to Alaska from Seattle. Since then, we have successfully relaunched 11 of our 28 vessels, with all three of our award winning brands resuming operations. We couldn't be more pleased with the performance of our relaunch ships. First, our crew has not missed a beat since returning. Seamlessly adapting to our new health and safety protocols and going above and beyond to deliver the exceptional vacation experiences our brands are known for. This commitment to service has resulted in record high guest satisfaction scores with each one sequentially better than the month before. And second, we are seeing the power of our industry-leading bundling strategy pay off and get our boarding our vessels with fresh wallet, which coupled with robust pent-up demand for all kinds of experiences, is translating to remarkably strong onboard revenue generation. In fact, onboard revenue has exceeded our base on expectations by over 20% with broad-based strength across all shifts, regions, and revenue streams. While I would caution though, against extrapolating these figures as permanent or indicative of steady-state future performance just yet, as there are several transitory factors that may be contributing to the elevated current level including pent-up demand, cabin, and guests mix, it is nonetheless an encouraging and positive signal of the healthy consumer demand we are experiencing. Lastly, and most importantly, these relaunched shifts have already contributed positive cash flow in the third quarter, even with our self-imposed occupancy level cap s. Despite a return to service going studying with the unfortunate summer stood as a Delta variant, I'm happy to say that our robust multilayered sales face health and safety protocols worked as designed to mitigate the introduction and transmission of COVID-19 aboard our vessels. The prevalence of cases we identified is pre -boarding testing, mid-Cruise and then at departation were in consequential and well below what we all saw in the general population during this time. In short, we were able to fairly evaluate and fine tune our rigorous protocols during one of the highest heights of the pandemic, and the stellar results speak for themselves. Today, all ships in our fleet continue operating with a strict 100% vaccination requirement, coupled with universal pre -embarkation testing and multiple layers of additional protection once onboard, including upgraded air filtration systems and well-resourced medical centers. We will continue to follow science and evaluate and modify our protocols as needed, with guidance from our team of experts led by former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, and former applicable Public Health Authority. As I have said, time and time again, our commitments at health and safety is far and away, the most important principle that our Company operates at all levels. And not just now, but pre and post pandemic as well. And we are willing to go to great lengths to protect our guests, crew and the communities we visit. Just last week, we were pleased to receive positive view from the CDC with a temporary extension of the framework for conditional sailing order through January 15, 2022, at which point the order will revert to a voluntary program. We view this as a positive step forward for our Company and the industry at large and we were encouraged to see positive recognition by the CDC of the successful resumption of cruising and the length we have all taken to enhance our already stringent health and safety protocols in response to COVID-19, which continue to be much more rigorous and much more comprehensive than those implemented by any other travel, leisure, or hospitality sector. With the progress of [indecipherable] is met with vaccinations, therapeutics, and adapting to living in the ongoing pandemic environment, the worst is seemingly behind us. Each day we become increasingly confident in our ability to flawlessly execute on our Phase Voyager assumption, which is detailed by Brian on Slide 5. We continue to expect our full fleet to be back in operation by April 1st of 2022, and with this steady and prudent trajectory, we are well-positioned for a projected return to pre-pandemic occupancy levels across our fleet no later than the beginning of the third quarter of 2022, and in time to capture peak summer season demand and pricing. While we expect to continue seeing some fits and start as we ramp up our relaunch, we are keeping a close watch on port availability, travel restrictions, and any other changes in global public health environment which could affect our return to service plans as we are ready to adapt accordingly. Turning to slide 6, we shift today's discussion to our booking and demand trends. I'm pleased to report that we continue to see robust future demand for cruising, particularly for sailings operating in the second half of 2022, and all of 2023 as evidenced by our record cumulative book position during these periods. You'll recall at the beginning of our third quarter, our booked position for full-year 2022 was meaningfully and significantly ahead of 2019's record levels and at higher pricing. However, in consistent with the pullback seen by the broader economy and in particular the travel and leisure sector, that summer Delta variant surge resulted in a marked slowdown in our net booking volumes. The impact was heavily weighted to closer in-sailings, particularly for fourth quarter 2021 and first quarter 2022, with the impact lessening sequentially throughout 2022 and beyond. Rather than chase scarce demand during the delta surge by dropping prices, and/or spending marketing funds in a less than optimal manner, we strategically chose to wait for consumer sentiment to rebound, as we have seen direct ebbs and flows in our booking patterns throughout the pandemic coinciding with changes in the public health environment. Throughout this difficult 10-week period, we remain disciplined and continue to hold or even raise pricing, and the outcome is that today, we see both record load and record pricing for the second half of 2022 and for all of 2023. We are intently focused on the long-term brand positioning and profitability of the Company and are simply not willing to sacrifice pricing in order to increase load factors in the upcoming transitional quarters. As it happened in past surges and as the COVID-19 situation recently improved, we have experienced a rebound in bookings, with net booking volumes improving sequentially over the past six weeks. We believe this improvement will accelerate moving forward at first. Our brands begin to ramp up their demand-generating marketing investments in mid-November, coinciding with Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotion. And second, the much anticipated and expected recovery in the travel agent channel space. And lastly, the approval of vaccines for children ages 5 to 11, which came just last night and will allow for an expanded group of 100% vaccinated guests, especially families, to sail on our brand. Our go-to-market and full vaccination strategy has paid off and drove. And today, our full-year 2022 load factor remains in line with 2019 record levels and at higher pricing, even when including the diluted impact of future cruise credits. In addition, we are meaningfully better booked for second half of 2022 and full-year 2023 sailings, and at better pricing that at any similar point in time in the past. Our primary focus continues to be on these periods when our fleet is expected to be in full operation and at normalized occupancy levels. and as I mentioned before, just in time to capture the all-important third quarter peak summer season, which traditionally is the most profitable quarter for the industry. Now, breaking down our book position for full-year 2022 further, more than 55% of bookings are from loyal repeat cruises to our brand. In addition, approximately 75% is comprised of new cash bookings with the remainder comprised of future cruise credit. So far, approximately 60% of the total value of our outstanding SECs have been redeemed. As a reminder, the value added 125% future cruise credits will issue -- will issue -- that we issued at the beginning of the pandemic can only be applied to sailings through year-end 2022, resulting in zero yield dilution when we look to 2023 and beyond. And while still early, booking trends with 2023 as I've -- as I hinted thus far, are also off to an impressive start. Our booking windows continue to be elongated versus historical level, with guests booking further into the future, particularly for the Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brand. Case in point in August, Regent set a record for the largest booking day in its 29-year history with the launch of its 2023/2024 voyage collection. Reservations surpassed its previous record by approximately 15%. And while all itineraries were popular, notable destinations of interest were Africa, Asia, and the Baltics, demonstrating our guests continued appetite for long and exotic itineraries. And in September, the sales launch of just a single ship, Oceania Cruise 's new 1200 passenger Vista, which doesn't debut until April of 2023, set an all-time single day booking record for that brand that surpassed the most recent record set in March of 2021 by nearly 60%. 1/2 of the available inventory for Vista's inaugural season, was sold in a single day, with 30% of bookings coming from new to brand guests. These incredible record-breaking milestones are further proof of the exceptional demand we continue to experience for our brand's unique product offerings from both new and loyal guests alike. Strong future demand in both load factor and pricing is also empirically evidenced in our advanced ticket sales bills. Our advanced ticket sales increased approximately $500 million on a gross basis in the quarter, equating to an approximately 65% increase versus the prior quarter's fill. In addition, and more importantly, our cash advanced ticket sales for sailings beginning in the second quarter of 2022 and beyond are approximately 45% higher than at the same time for record year 2019. As we move forward with phasing in the rest of our fleet, we expect this tremendous momentum to continue sequentially. Looking to the future of 2022 will also mark an exciting new chapter for our Company as we welcome the first shift in the next class of vessels for Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Prima, in summer of 2022. I just returned from the shipyard in Italy a few weeks ago where I was able to witness firsthand what an evolution, Prima, is for them, the Regent brand, and for the industry at large, which you can see on slide 7. Everything about her was impressive and she has been meticulously designed to elevate the guest experience. Last month, we unveiled Prima 's entertainment lineup, including its interactive headline show, the Tony-award nominated musical Summer, the Donna Summer Musical. Norwegian Prima will also showcase numerous cruise industry first and new to brand experiences, including the world's first transforming venue that converts from a three-story theater into a Vegas style nightclub, exhilarating freefall drop dry slide, and a tri -level 1200 foot long race track, the largest at sea. The Prima Speedway will be the first ever three level race track and is over 20% larger than that on Norwegian Encore, featuring 14 turns, where drivers can reach speed of nearly 40 miles per hour. Prima's advanced sales continue to impress, even after her record shattering sales debut in May, which set a single best booking day and best initial booking week record, doubling the previous record set by Norwegian Bliss in 2018. And despite the introduction being six weeks later than Norwegian Bliss. Our booking volumes are trending in line with data Bliss the previous fastest selling new builds for the line and a materially higher prices. As you can see on Slide 8, Norwegian Prima is just the first ship to look forward to in our industry-leading growth profile of nine world-class ships coming online to 2027. This new-build will grow our berth count by approximately 40%, adding 24,000 additional berth across our three brands. In 2023 when our fleet is back in full force, we expect our berth capacity to be approximately 20% higher than 2019's pre-pandemic levels. The addition of these new cutting-edge ships will also favorably change our cabin mix as illustrated on slide 9, with premium cabins increasing to approximately 65% of total berth versus approximately 60% today. In addition to the premium mix of real estate onboard, our new ships have all the bells and whistles, additional streams for onboard revenue generation with new and innovative experiences, and the latest technology to improve efficiency versus our existing fleet. Excitement around new ships is also a significant demand driver and a powerful engine to fuel future yields, EBITDA, cash flow and ROIC growth. It brings new guests to our brand s, and it brings back repeat guests as well, helping us to appeal to every segment that we are targeting. And given our base of only 28 ships in our fleet, we are ready and eager to easily and profitably absorb this new capacity as it will allow us to further diversify our product offerings and penetrate numerous attractive and high potential unserved and underserved markets globally. The strategic addition of the Prima and Prima Plus Class, for example, which are smaller but more upscale than our previous Breakaway and Breakaway Plus Class at approximately 3,200 berth for the first two Prima Class Ships, and increasing to nearly 3,600 berths for the next four Prima's Plus Class Ships will give us additional bandwidth and flexibility to optimize the deployments that are most profitable and allow the line to continue to manning premium pricing with the right size ship in the right place and at the right time. And as slide 10 shows, we have historically demonstrated our success and not only absorbing capacity, but translating this capacity growth into outsized revenue, outsized adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow growth that significantly outpaces the growth in absolute capacity. We fully expect to continue this trend and drive meaningful growth to the top and bottom line with the addition of these exciting new ships. I'll be back later to provide an update on our ESG efforts, as well as provide the closing remarks. But for now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark for a financial update. Mark? ","Thank you, Frank. We reached a significant financial milestone in the third quarter with our first voyages resuming sailing after a previously unimaginable, 500 plus days with zero revenue-generating operations. Our return to service has been very successful and we remain on track to execute on our Phase Voyager resumption plan. By the end of the third quarter, we had started 37 voyages, completed 29, and had 8 ships in service, representing approximately 40% of our berth capacity. Occupancy in the third quarter was approximately 57%, in line with our expectations and reflecting our self-imposed occupancy limits. As we have outlined previously, we have taken a conservative approach to occupancy with our voyage resumption, which proved to be prudent with the rise of the Delta variant, to ensure that health and safety remains our number one priority. Increasing our occupancy is not a race, and we are focused on being diligent and thoughtful in ramping up of occupancy levels to protect not just our guests and crew, but also our long-term brand equity. Despite the reduced occupancy levels in the quarter, I am extremely happy to report that the fleet that operated in the period was cash flow positive. Looking ahead, by year-end, we expect to have 17 ships representing approximately 75% of capacity back in service with the full fleet operating as we enter the second quarter 2022. Turning to liquidity and cash burn on Slide 11, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents. In addition, earlier this week, we further enhanced our liquidity profile by entering into one billion commitment, through mid-August 2022. This liquidity backstop enhances our financial flexibility and provides immediate and additional liquidity should the need arise. If drawn, the commitment would convert into an unsecured note maturing in April 2024. For sake of clarity, we have not drawn on this facility and do not intend to do so given our current projected recovery at this time. As for cash [Phonetic] for the third quarter, Our average monthly cash burn rate was approximately 275 million lower than prior guidance of 285 million. For the fourth quarter, we expect our average monthly cash burn to increase to approximately 350 million as we continue to ramp up restart expenses and additional vessels reenter service. During the quarter, we are expecting a ramp up of demand-generating marketing investments as we head into the holidays with Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Wave Season. It is important to note that this cash burn estimate does not include our expected cash inflows from both new and existing bookings, or the contribution from shifts that have reentered service, both of which we expect to accelerate as we move forward. On a net basis, based on our current resumption plan, we continue to expect to reach a crucial inflection point with operating cash flow turning positive toward the tail under the first quarter of 2022. In addition, based on our current trajectory and market conditions, we are on a solid path to return to profitability for the second half of 2022. Turning to slide 12, our cash balance in the third quarter decreased to $1.9 billion of cash and equivalents, driven by approximately $825 million of operating cash burn, including Opex expenses, SG&A interest and Capex, customer cash refunds of approximately $115 million, and net working capital and other inflows of approximately $125 million, which is net of health and safety investments and cash collections from current and future voyages. With 2022 now just around the corner, we have provided some additional guidance to assist with modeling for certain metrics on slide 17, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, fuel consumption, and capital expenditures. In addition, we have provided detail on our annual capacity growth expectations on Slide 18. As we gear up to deliver on our impressive growth profile through 2027, which we expect to be meaningfully accretive to both earnings and cash flow generation. Lastly, with much of the focus in the market on inflationary pressure, I wanted to touch quickly on what we're experiencing. We're still fine-tuning our 2022 plans and related projections, and we'll provide more color on our cost outlook on our next earnings call. However, similar to almost all other industries, we are seeing pockets of pressures in areas such as fuel, food, and other commodities. Our supply chain group continues to work diligently to mitigate these costs. And we are fortunate that the timing of our ramp-up in operations is relieving some of the transitory cost pressures. The good news is that we are a primarily fixed cost business, which is beneficial in an inflationary environment. On the labor front, we have a high degree of visibility on our costs as the vast majority of our crew, which comprises the bulk of our employee base, are covered under multi-year agreements. On the flip side, we're also seeing very strong pricing power, which is helping to offset inflationary crusher. Even with the pricing power we are seeing, cruise vacations continue to operate incredibly compelling value proposition versus a land-based vacation alternative. We have said in the past, that a cruise vacation typically offers at least 20% to 30% better value, than a similar land-based alternative. With the current inflationary backdrop and on a relative scale, we believe our offering and value proposition is even more compelling now than ever before. Without the same labor market pressures that many of our land-based peers are experiencing, we can provide a consistent and exceptional level of service for our guests, which is evidenced by our record, high guest satisfaction scores since resuming sailing. These factors combined will continue to allow us to further increase our prices on our multi-year strategy to achieving pricing parity to that of land-based vacation offerings. Before handing the call back to Frank, I want to reiterate that while the global public health environment remains fluid, and we are not yet completely out of the woods, we are increasingly optimistic as we continue on our road to recovery. We are now in a position to pivot to a more offensive approach and shift our attention to executing on our medium and long-term financial recovery plan, which is outlined on slide 13. As part of this plan, we will remain focused on rebuilding our strong track record of financial performance, optimizing our Balance Sheet, and delivering on our attractive and disciplined growth profile. I look forward to updating you on our progress in our next call. But for now, I will hand the call back over to Frank to provide closing commentary. Frank?

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NCLH) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 6, 2021","Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. As always, I hope that all of you joining us today as well as your loved ones remain healthy and safe. Before I go into my prepared remarks and if you haven't already heard the good news, I would like to congratulate Andrea on her new appointment to Chief Sales and Marketing Officer of our luxury brand, Regent Seven Seas Cruises. After more than 30 earnings calls with our Company, we will all miss her but wish her the very best of luck in her new role. Jessica John, who many of you have already met, will assume the role of Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Communications and ESG, beginning September 1. Congratulations, Andrea and Jessica. I am pleased to say that we are taking this morning's call from Seattle, Washington, as we prepare for a very exciting day tomorrow, the relaunch of our first ship from the United States in over 16 months. And as Andrea mentioned, we also have a very special guest with us today, former FDA Commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb. After over a year of working together remotely to reach his long-awaited milestone, it is truly a pleasure to finally meet Dr. Gottlieb and the other public health experts on our SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council in person. And for the first time today, as we kick off our Great Cruise Comeback. Today, we will focus our commentary on the progress we have made on our return to cruising, our comprehensive plan for the phased resumption of operations for our entire 28-ship fleet, and the record-setting strength we continue to experience in consumer demand, which has translated into a record load and record pricing for calendar year 2022 and beyond. As you can see on Slide 4, our return to service plan is centered around three key phases. First, we developed our multi-layered SailSAFE health and safety strategy, including mandatory FDA, WHO, or EMA authorized vaccinations for all guests and crew at its cornerstone. In addition, we test all guests at the terminal prior to embarkation and all crew undergo weekly routine testing. Next, we have now announced voyage resumption plans for all 28 ships in our fleet. And lastly, we are intently focused on the flawless execution of the phased relaunch of our fleet, which we expect to complete by April 1, 2022. Against a still ever-changing COVID backdrop, we remain vigilant and ready to adapt as needed, keeping a close watch on port availability, travel restrictions, and any changes to the global public health environment which could affect our planned operations. Overall, we are encouraged to see some relaxation of travel restrictions and opening of borders in recent weeks, particularly for vaccinated travelers. Just a few weeks ago, Canada moved up its plans to allow the return of cruise ships in November, four months earlier than previously announced. Many countries in the EU are now allowing travelers from the U.S. and in the past few weeks, both Canada and the U.K. announced entry to back air [Phonetic] travelers without quarantine. Travel restrictions and port closures do remain in place in other parts of the world, but we are ready to execute on our cruise assumption strategy and have backup plans ready to go, which we can implement and adapt to as needed. Slide 5 details our voyage resumption plans by brand and by vessel. After 500 days, the time has finally come and I could not be more pleased to say that our Great Cruise Comeback officially commenced last week with Norwegian Jade operating Greek Isle voyages out of Athens. The relaunch went off without a hitch and demonstrated that strict vaccination requirements, comprehensive pre-boarding testing, and a suite of other robust protocols are working as designed to help mitigate the introduction and transmission of COVID-19 aboard our vessels. A special thank you goes out to the offices and crew of Norwegian Jade, who even after 16 months of not operating, seamlessly adapted our new protocols and delivered the same exceptional service and world-class cruise experience that our guests expect from our Company. As an indication of this top-notch service delivery, our onboard revenue on this first significantly exceeded our target which was focused on 2019 actual results by over 50%. All of our incredible team members around the world worked tirelessly to prepare for this critical moment, and I am truly grateful for the privilege to work day in and day out alongside such a dedicated, passionate, and talented team. I also want to express our sincere thanks to our loyal guests, valued travel partners, and all of our stakeholders for their patience and support during these challenging times as we ramp up our return to cruise plans. Norwegian Jade's successful relaunch is just the first of many to come, including our much anticipated return to cruising in the United States. Tomorrow Norwegian Encore, the line's newest and most innovative ship will make her West Coast debut with a seven-night sailings to Alaska from Seattle. We are looking forward to once again bringing guests to explore the last frontier, one of the most popular destinations with our guests and providing some much needed economic relief to the communities, families, and small businesses throughout coastal Alaska, who have been devastated by the loss of cruise tourism revenue during this prolonged suspension. The next step in our relaunch plan is our return to Miami, the cruise capital of the world. I'd like to address a request for a preliminary injunction that we filed last month which will allow us to confirm guests' vaccination status for sailings departing from the State of Florida that has been heard in [Indecipherable] Miami Federal Court today. Combating this virus is an unprecedented historic challenge that requires everyone, including governments at the local, state, and federal levels, plus private enterprise and society at large, to do their part. I have a tremendous empathy for our elected officials, business leaders, friends and families, neighbors, who are all doing the best they can under enormously difficult circumstances to beat back this virus. Having had the pleasure to work in the cruise industry for nearly 30 years, I am confident that in the current global health environment and especially with the rise of the Delta variant, having a fully vaccinated and tested population onboard our vessels is the best path to keeping our guests, our dedicated crew members, and the people of the communities we visit, safe from COVID. In order to do that, we must be able to confirm vaccination status of our guests at every port we sail from, including those in the State of Florida. We owe it to all our stakeholders who do everything possible to make sure we deliver on this critical mission. We hope that the Federal Court will agree with our vision and our mission. When we say the health and safety of our guests, crew, and communities we visit is a number one priority, we mean it. It is not a slogan nor a tag line. The legal actions we have taken in Florida reflect our deep commitment to resume sailing in accordance with our robust, science-backed SailSAFE health and safety protocols outlined on Slide 6. Our policy of 100% vaccinations coupled with pre-boarding testing of guests and routine testing of crew is in place without issue in the nearly 100 ports we sail to and from around the world except Florida ports. Nothing takes priority over health and safety, and we have gone to great lengths and expense to pursue this commitment to our guests, crew, and all stakeholders. Again, this commitment is not a slogan nor a tag line. Health and safety is far and away the most important principle to guide how our Company operates at all levels, and this fundamental philosophy has never been more important than right now. We want to use every tool available to us that science and medicine have developed to prepare our ships to return to service and vaccines are the most powerful tool. Given that we have Dr. Gottlieb here today, who is not only a world-renowned expert but is also the Chairman of our SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council, I'd like to give him the floor for his thoughts on our health and safety program. Dr. Gottlieb? ","Thank you, Frank. Our remarks today will focus on the continued execution of our COVID-19's financial action plan, our liquidity profile, and our all-important phased voyage resumption plan. I am pleased with the significant progress we've made on our return to cruising. As Frank mentioned, we are here in Seattle ready to relaunch Norwegian Encore, tomorrow. We have a comprehensive voyage resumption plan in place and are focused on the execution of this phased relaunch. We expect to have eight ships representing approximately 40% of our total capacity, operating by the end of the third quarter, and 17 ships representing approximately 75% of our capacity by year-end. The last ship, Oceania's Nautica will emerge better than new after an extensive drydock and reinspiration and join the rest of the fleet on April 1, 2022. While we've reached several important milestones on our road to recovery, we recognize that the global health environment is still fluid, so we remain focused on maintaining our cost discipline and pulling all available levers to conserve cash and maximize financial flexibility as we execute our relaunch plan. As you can see on Slide 12, since the halt in global cruise operations in March of 2020, we worked quickly to implement our COVID-19 financial action plan. During the pause in operations, we successfully reduced operating expenses by nearly 60% and capital expenditures by over 75%. As we ready our ships to return to service, costs will increase as expected, but we will do so in a strategic and disciplined manner to balance our cash needs while maintaining a strong liquidity profile. Since the beginning of the second quarter, we've taken several additional proactive measures on our financial action plan. We continue to significantly reduce or defer near-term demand-generating marketing expenses and non-essential capital expenditures. In July, we amended nine credit facilities for our newbuild program to increase the commitments by approximately $770 million to cover owner supply costs, modification costs, and financing premium fees. We want to thank our banking partners for their continued support of our Company during these extremely challenging times. Turning to our liquidity and cash burn on Slide 13. We had approximately $2.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30. This provides us with significant financial flexibility to continue to navigate through this fluid environment and execute on our return-to-service plan. As for cash burn for the second quarter, our average monthly cash burn rate was approximately $200 million per month. This was slightly higher than our guidance of $190 million, driven by the announcement of additional ship relaunches in our voyage resumption plan and the associated restart expenses. As for the third quarter, we expect our average monthly cash burn rate to increase to approximately $285 million as restart expenses accelerate with additional vessels entering service. Restart expenses are primarily related to repositioning, provisioning, and staffing of vessels, implementing new health and safety protocols, and a measured ramp-up of demand-generating marketing investments. Note that this cash burn estimate does not include our expected cash inflows from both new and existing bookings. We will continue to take a disciplined approach to reintroducing costs as voyages resume, while at the same time balancing the need to drive new cash bookings. Looking ahead, based on our resumption plan, we expect to reach a crucial inflection point with operating cash flow turning positive over the course of the first quarter of 2022. To assist with modeling, Slide 22 details additional guidance we have provided for certain metrics, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and newbuild related capital expenditures. Turning to Slide 14. We ended the second quarter with approximately $2.8 billion of cash. Our cash balance in the second quarter decreased driven primarily by approximately $600 million of operating cash burn, including operating expenses, SG&A, interest and capex, customer cash refunds for canceled voyages of approximately $150 million, and net working capital and other outflows of approximately $10 million, which includes health and safety investments. Before handing the call back to Frank, I want to reiterate that as we continue to navigate through this crisis and relaunch our fleet over the next few quarters, we have not taken our focus off the future. Our relaunch milestones bring us one step closer to executing on our medium and long-term financial recovery plan as outlined on Slide 15. And to rebuild and continue to drive margin expansion, maximize cash flow generation, and optimize our balance sheet. With that, I'll hand the call back to Frank to provide closing comments.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NCLH) Q1 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 6, 2021","Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. As always, I hope that all of you joining us today, as well as your loved ones, remain healthy and safe. Today, we will focus our commentary on the progress we have made thus far toward the resumption of cruising, the overall strength of the booking and pricing environment and our efforts to bolster our liquidity and maximize financial flexibility as we methodically return our fleet to operations. Over a year since the suspension of voyages worldwide, our team at Norwegian has accelerated, yet the time has finally come to where we shift our focus to what I like to call our Great Cruise Comeback, even if the comeback starts from international ports. As you can see on slide four, our return to service plan is centered around three key phases. First, we developed our multilayered SailSAFE health and safety strategy, including mandatory vaccinations for all guests and crew at its cornerstone, which I will touch on in more detail later in the call. Second, last month, we announced our initial voyage resumption plan with a two-pronged approach to restarting cruises from both within and outside of U.S. waters starting this summer. All three of our brands have now announced initial voyages embarking from both new and normally scheduled international ports, and we are -- and we remain engaged in active dialogue with the CDC regarding a potential resumption of cruising from U.S. ports. Lastly is the phased relaunch of the remainder of our fleet, the timing of which will depend on several factors such as the global public health environment, port openings, travel restrictions and the all-important CDC. Slide five further details our 2-pronged voyage resumption plan. Outside of the U.S., our long-awaited return to cruising will begin in July, first with three Norwegian Cruise Line vessels sailing from Athens and throughout the Greek Isles and new Caribbean home ports in Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. Oceania Cruises will start in late August with voyages from Copenhagen, and Regent Seven Seas Cruises will resume from South Hampton England beginning in September, with Seven Seas Splendor, our newest and most luxurious vessel, resuming her inaugural season. The response to our international voyage resumption has been overwhelming, and even sailings from our new Caribbean home ports are performing better than expected, despite the extremely condensed booking window. I can't thank our loyal guests, value travel partners and all of our stakeholders enough for their patience and support over the past year as we prepare for our return to cruising. As for our work to restart voyages in the U.S., on April 5, we submitted a comprehensive ironclad proposal to the CDC requesting authorization to resume cruising this summer with the robust and healthy safety strategy I just described, which includes 100% vaccination of all guests and crew. We and the rest of the cruise industry have since continued dialogue with the CDC. And just last week, the CDC issued additional clarification for its previously outlined technical guidance, which alleviated some of the pain points in the original Phase IIa guidance. Even more importantly, we were pleased to see the CDC incorporate vaccines, our most powerful tool against COVID-19, into its guidance, creating two different pathways for the resumption of cruising from U.S. ports: one for vaccinated voyages with a vaccination threshold of 95% for guests and 98% for crew; and one for nonvaccinated voyages that fall below this threshold. The vaccinated path, which is consistent with, but falls short of, our plan for 100% vaccination of guests and crew has fewer hurdles to clear before we turn to cruising, including the removal of the requirement for simulated voyages prior to revenue sailings and the relaxing of certain burdensome and costly testing requirements. In addition, yesterday, the CDC issued technical guidance for Phase IIb and III, which covers simulated voyages and restricted voyages and the application process for a conditional sailing certificate. The guidance includes an operations manual for simulated and restricted voyages for which we need more clarity on whether the numerous and onerous requirements would apply to vaccinated voyages as well or only to those that are not. Our team is working through the new guidance. But at first glance, however, it appears the path forward is a bit rockier and a bit steeper than originally expected. As time goes by, and given how long it takes to stand up a shift from cold layup, the urgent need for an acceptable and definitive agreement with the CDC is imperative as a potential mid-summer restart from U.S. ports could be in jeopardy. However, the CDC's recent willingness to engage with the industry in constructive dialogue has shown that they are committed to working with us to find an acceptable path forward, and we are certainly in a better place today than we were just 30 days ago. The progress we have made so far has been possible in part due to the incredible grassroot efforts undertaken across the cruise ecosystem to encourage elected officials to help resume cruising in the U.S., which supports thousands of jobs, families and small businesses throughout the country. Through CLIA's Ready, Set, Sail platform, and our own Safe to Sail advocacy campaign, we were able to send over 150,000 messages to elected officials throughout the United States. Thank you to all of you who have called, emailed or tweeted your officials in support of the cruise industry. The wind is at our back, and now is the time to keep the positive momentum going with our advocacy efforts, so I encourage you to continue reaching out to your elected officials by cruising -- or excuse me, by texting Cruise to 52886 and have your voices heard. Turning to slide six. We unveiled our robust and multilayered SailSAFE health and safety program, which includes mandatory vaccinations for all guests and crew as its cornerstone. We believe that vaccinations, combined with a dozens of science-backed preventive protocols, including universal COVID-19 testing that were developed by the Healthy Sail Panel, will provide one of, if not, the safest vacation option available anywhere on land or at sea. Our protocols extend well beyond those of the already successfully reopened travel and hospitality sectors, including hotels, resorts, casinos, theme parks, restaurants, movie theaters, arenas and airlines. SailSAFE was developed in conjunction with our expert advisors, including the Healthy Sail Panel and our newly announced SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council chaired by former FDA Commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb. The Council, which is comprised of six public health and scientific experts featured on slide seven, will complement the work of the Healthy Sail Panel and provide Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings with specific expert advice on the implementation and continuous improvement of our SailSAFE program. Shifting to our booking trends, which you can see on slide eight, we continue to see the strongest demand we have ever experienced for future cruise vacations across all three of our brands, despite continued reductions of demand-generating marketing investments, the absence of a full complement of our all-important travel agent partners and a virtual lockdown for many of our international source markets. Perhaps the best indicator of this pent-up demand is our booking volumes, which, during what is probably the most unorthodox wait season in our industry's history, accelerated considerably with bookings net of cancellations more than doubling versus the prior quarter. As I touched on at our last call, this demand, coupled with the opening of voyages for sale further in advance, continues to result in a significant expansion of the booking curve, with the first quarter's curve nearly doubling versus the same time last year. Pent-up demand is particularly evident for 2022 voyages. For the first half of 2022, our load factor is meaningfully ahead of 2019, with pricing higher when excluding the dilutive impact of future cruise credits. Keep in mind that 2019 was a record year, which makes the strong booking trends we are experiencing even more impressive. In addition, approximately 70% of our book position is comprised of new cash bookings, with the remainders comprised of future cruise certificates. By the time summer 2021 comes around and the industry begins to resume operations, more than 50 million would-be cruises will have been left ashore, so the pent-up demand is real and it's deep, and you can see that in our growing advanced ticket sales, which increased approximately $200 million on a gross basis in the quarter or up approximately 40% versus the prior quarter's build. We believe we have reached an inflection point, as this is the highest gross build since the beginning of the pandemic. And as we get closer to our resumption of cruising and begin phasing in the rest of our fleet, we expect this momentum to continue to accelerate sequentially. Another exciting milestone reached in the quarter was the naming of Vista, the first of two new 1,200 guest Allura Class ships for the Oceania Cruises brand and the first new build to the line in over a decade, which you can see on slide nine. The upscale vessel, the seventh for the line, will set sail in early 2023 followed by a sister ship in 2025. Like her sister vessels, Vista will deliver the finest cuisine at sea and will introduce several unique first for the brand in the realm of dining and guest experience. More reveals of Vista's venues and experiences will begin later this month, and the lead-up to the launch and sails for her inaugural voyages in September of 2021. I'll be back later to provide an update on our ESG efforts as well as provide closing remarks. But now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark for a financial update. Mark? ","Thank you, Frank. My remarks today will focus on the continued execution of our COVID-19 financial action plan and our planned return to cruising later this summer. I am pleased to say that we are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel, with the significant progress we have made in recent months on our return to cruising. Despite this positive momentum, we have not lost sight that the pandemic is not yet over, and we remain focused on maintaining our cost discipline and pulling all levers available to conserve cash and maximize financial flexibility in what is an improving but still uncertain environment. As I have said before, our team is focused on what we can control, and we continue to adapt our strategy as needed as the pandemic evolves. Slide 10 illustrates the three focus areas of our action plan and the additional proactive measures taken since the beginning of the first quarter. First, we continue to tightly control operating expenses and capital expenditures through a number of initiatives, including the significant reduction or outright deferral of near-term demand-generating marketing expenses and nonessential capital expenditures. As an example, our non-newbuild capital expenditures continue to be less than half our pre-pandemic expectations for 2021. In addition, we finalized EUR50 million of incremental deferrals of newbuild-related shipyard payments since our last earnings call, resulting in a total deferral of EUR270 million through the end of the second quarter 2022. Second, we have made significant progress on improving our debt maturity profile to provide additional near-term financial flexibility. In March, we repaid the Pride of America and Norwegian Jewel facilities, which were set to mature in 2022, leaving no significant debt maturities until 2024. We also worked with our lenders to amend certain credit agreements to free up approximately $2 billion of additional debt capacity, most of which is on an unsecured basis. While we believe our liquidity position today is strong, this incremental debt capacity meaningfully improves our financial flexibility and gives us additional optionality should the need arise. And the final focus of -- area of our action plan is securing additional capital. We successfully tapped the market, which resulted in an approximately $1 billion of incremental liquidity in the quarter. Slide 11 illustrates the two highly successful capital market transactions executed in March. First, we issued $1.1 billion of senior unsecured notes consisting of a $575 million tack-on to the December unsecured notes offering and $525 million of new unsecured notes due 2028. These transactions generated approximately $650 million of incremental liquidity after repaying the Norwegian Jewel and Pride of America facilities, both of which were to mature in 2022. Second, we went to the market with a strategic multifaceted offering to proactively manage our balance sheet. We raised approximately $1.6 billion of proceeds net of underwriting fees through a public common equity offering of approximately 53 million shares at $30 per share. We then used approximately $1 billion of the net proceeds to fully repay the L Catterton exchangeable notes due 2026. This opportunistic transaction had several strategic benefits. First, it enhanced our balance sheet by effectively converting debt to equity with the prepayment of debt at par. Second, the early redemption of the L Catterton notes enabled us to repurchase a significantly lower number of shares than what would have been required if the notes were held to maturity. Third, we unlocked value and added approximately $530 million of incremental liquidity, with limited additional dilution to shareholders, as the vast majority of the shares were already reserved for the L Catterton notes. And lastly, we reduced our future interest expense burden. To date, we've accessed the capital market 7 times over a 12-month period with several multi-instrument transactions. As a result, since the onset of the pandemic, we've raised more than $7.5 billion, including the drawdown of the $875 million revolver early last year. This incredible feat would not have been possible without the hard work, support and partnership of countless individuals, including our team at Norwegian, our lenders, the shipyards, investors, bankers and many, many more. Turning to our illustrative liquidity profile on Slide 12. Total liquidity as of March 31 was approximately $3.4 billion, which is net of the portion of customer deposit refunds that are included in accounts payable as of quarter end. We have also estimated approximately $100 million for anticipated health and safety investments. These factors combined result in a net liquidity on a pro forma basis of approximately $3.3 billion, enabling us to continue to navigate through this fluid environment and execute on our return to service plan. As for cash burn, our team continues to be laser-focused on cost containment and cash conservation. For the first quarter, our average monthly cash burn was in line with prior guidance at approximately $190 million or approximately $170 million per month, excluding nonrecurring debt modification costs. We paid approximately $50 million of onetime costs in the quarter as a result of debt deferrals and covenant waivers and suspensions, which, when combined with the newbuild payment extensions, have resulted in approximately $1 billion of additional liquidity through first quarter of 2022. As for the second quarter, we expect the average cash burn to be approximately $190 million per month as we prepare for a resumption of cruising beginning in July. Restart expenses are primarily related to repositioning, provisioning and staffing of vessels, implementing new health and safety protocols and a measured ramp-up of demand-generating marketing investments. We will continue to be disciplined and take a thoughtful approach to reintroducing costs with our voyage resumptions in order to conserve cash while, at the same time, balancing the need to drive new cash bookings. Slide 21 details additional guidance we have provided for certain metrics, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense and newbuild-related capital expenditures. Turning to slide 13. We ended the first quarter with approximately $3.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our balance -- our cash balance in the first quarter increased driven by approximately $1.2 billion of net proceeds from capital raises. This was partially offset by approximately $570 million of operating cash burn, including operating expenses, SG&A, interest and capex; customer cash refunds for canceled voyages of approximately $100 million; collateral obligations of approximately $250 million; and a net working capital and other outflow of approximately $50 million, which includes health and safety investments. Before handing the call back to Frank, I want to reiterate that, as we continue to navigate through this crisis and prepare to execute on our voyage resumption plans, we have not taken our focus off the future. Our medium- and long-term financial recovery plan, which is provided on slide 14, is focused on three critical components: first, rebuilding and gradually returning to pre-COVID margin levels, while continuing to identify opportunities to further drive margin expansion; second, maximize our cash generation; and third, focus on optimizing our balance sheet and charting a path to delever. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank for closing commentary. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/06/norwegian-cruise-line-holdings-ltd-nclh-q1-2021-ea/
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NCLH) Q4 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 26, 2021","Thank you, Andrea, and good morning. I hope that everyone joining us today as well as your loved ones remain healthy and safe. Similar to our last few earnings calls, we will focus our commentary today on the progress of our response to the global COVID-19 pandemic; the overall booking and pricing environment, which has shown particular strength in recent weeks; and our view of what the month ahead may look like as we prepare for an eventual return to service. To say that 2020 was challenging would be an incredible understatement as it was, without a doubt, the toughest and most difficult year in our company's 50-plus year history. After a record-breaking 2019, the foundation was well set for 2020 to be even a more successful year. That upward trajectory, however, quickly changed last March. And 2020 instead became a year of great hardship and disappointment and one in which we had to rely on our nimbleness and our ability to adapt by taking swift, proactive and decisive actions to overcome the multifaceted challenges presented by the pandemic. These actions included bringing our entire fleet to a halt literally overnight, followed by the complex logistics of safely returning more than 50,000 of our guests home. Next came the challenge of repatriating over 25,000 of our crew members and finding safe haven for our 28 vessels, all while transitioning them to various states of reduced manning. We quickly bolstered our liquidity through multiple capital market transactions, totaling in excess of $6 billion and led the industry in establishing cutting-edge health and safety standards through the cofounding of the Healthy Sail Panel. I'm incredibly proud and profoundly grateful for the dedication and perseverance demonstrated by our team members who continue to adapt, innovate and flawlessly execute while faced with unprecedented challenges. The tremendous efforts of our team are what have enabled our company to prove our resilience, time and again in the past and gives me confidence we will do so again. As we survey the current public health situation, both in America and around the world, it is extraordinary to consider just how much has transpired in the few months since our last update. As expected, the fourth quarter resurgence of the virus drove caseload to record highs, resulting in renewed lockdown and stricter global travel restrictions. During this time, perhaps the most important breakthrough though was the needed -- to defeat the pandemic was the coming online of several vaccines that were authorized for emergency use. Fast forward to today and caseloads across the globe have been in decline since mid-January, while simultaneously, vaccination programs are ramping up where currently over six million doses are being administered globally daily, a number that will only increase as manufacturing, distribution and healthcare systems align. So where does that put us in the cruise industry? In reality, we're not sure. But directionally, we're headed in the right direction to an eventual restart of cruising. Public health experts do predict that caseload, while already on the downside, will continue to decline primarily for three reasons: first, a significant portion of the population has already been infected and recovered; second, the number of individuals vaccinated will rapidly increase; and lastly, we will soon move into the less troublesome spring and summer season. All three of these factors are expected to combine to begin establishing herd immunity sometime during the third quarter, with the spread of variants and the durability of vaccine protection being the two main variables that could slow down but not completely halt the rapid progress being made. And while we are moving in the right direction, scientists continue to caution that we are not yet out of the woods, the crisis is far from over and we must all remain vigilant and ready to adapt to the ongoing fluidity of the public health environment. Our industry has recently seen some encouraging green shoots. After the first quarter resurgence caused nascent cruise operations in Europe to temporarily halt, several European cruise lines have since resumed or are planning to return to service in the next few weeks, sourcing EU nationals from Italy and Germany. The hope and expectation is that by late spring, sailings will expand to include cross-border European nationals, and eventually, likely during the third quarter, international guests, as virus prevalence decreases to manageable level. Shifting to our company's recent events since our last earnings call, several key milestones marked the fourth quarter, which can be found on slide three of our presentation. These include two capital raises, resulting in approximately $1.7 billion of additional liquidity; new debt deferral amendments providing additional financial flexibility; and continued progress on our environmental, social and governance initiatives, which I will touch on in more detail later in the call. On slide four, we outlined the actions we have undertaken as we continue to navigate through this crisis, remaining focused on what we can control. Subsequent to the issuance of the CDC's Conditional Sail Order in October, we anticipated a return to service in the first quarter of 2021. Since it takes up to 90 days to ready a ship to reenter servers from layup status, we initiated a phased crew restaffing of select vessels and began a ramping up of marketing activities. This initiative, unfortunately, was met with several headwinds, most notably, the rise of confirmed cases to all-time high and the emergence of new variants, which combined with a slower-than-anticipated rollout of vaccination programs, additional lockdowns and travel restrictions, continued closure of key ports around the world and, most important, the reluctance by public health authorities to lift cruise suspension. These headwinds caused us to change course. With a much hope for a Q1 relaunch postponed, the decision was made to return vessels to reduce manning status until there is certainty on the timing for a return to service. With new crew rested, ready and eager to work, we took the opportunity to rotate certain crew that had been onboard beyond their usual contracted term and made the difficult decision to repatriate 4,000 crew members back to their home countries. Next, we continue to execute on our strategic financial action plan, which Mark will provide an update on, and on the incremental actions we have taken to bolster liquidity a little later in the call. Turning to our road map to relaunch, which is illustrated on slide five. We continue to work with the Healthy Sail Panel, along with the CDC and other public health authorities and governments across the globe, to prepare for a safe and healthy resumption of cruising. As we await for additional technical guidelines from the CDC and other public health officials around the world, we continue to make progress on enhancing our already rigorous health and safety standards, implementing new advancements, including digital technology for contract tracing as well as streamlining safety drill with our state-of-the-art e-mustering technology. While we are confident in the ability of the 74 protocols developed by the Healthy Sail Panel to keep our ships, crew and guests safe, our frontline defense strategy has expanded from protocol-led preventive measures to now also include the protective health and safety benefits of vaccines. We view vaccine as a powerful tool, the most powerful tool, that when combined with various protective measures society is already accustomed to, such as space coverings and physical distancing, forms a multilayered, science-based approach to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 infection. We expect that by the time cruising resumes, vaccination will most certainly be widely available in the developed world. And we believe that by then, we will be able to secure vaccines for our crew as we are today well along in the procurement process. A mix of vaccinated guests and crew, along with the other established protocols, will provide a powerful combination to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 onboard our ships and the communities we visit. Ports and destinations is the next step of our road map, and we are in constant communication with key ports around the world to assess the status of travel restrictions, quarantine requirements and port availability. Of particular importance to the industry was the recent announcement by Canadian authorities to restrict cruise vessels from operating in Canadian waters through February of 2022. Throughout this pandemic, the travel industry has experienced the introduction, subsequent repeal and reintroduction of lockdowns and travel restrictions depending on the prevalence of the virus and other factors. Thankfully, the Canadian order allows for the suspension to be rescinded based on improvement in public health. We remain cautiously optimistic that a recision may be possible. And in the meantime, we await the results of several Alaskan delegation-led initiatives, which we want to acknowledge today and greatly appreciate that may allow Alaska Cruises to operate in 2021. The third step in our road map is to begin reactivating our sales and marketing machine, which as you know, is guided by our industry-leading market-to-fill versus discount-to-fill strategy. We have revalidated the effectiveness of this strategy in the pandemic environment, generating demand for the back half of 2021 and especially strong demand into 2022 and beyond. We will resume a disciplined process of ramping up sales and marketing efforts once we finalize an initial voyage resumption plan. Lastly, and once there is certainty, we continue to expect a gradual and phased approach to the resumption of cruise voyages. Depending on the timing of our return to service, our vessels could return in certain regions before others. For example, given the seasonality of our operations, a typical year the deployment of our vessel is concentrated in Europe during the peak summer season with 17 of our 28 ships operating in this region. Therefore, seasonality will likely play a key role in the initial deployment of our vessels. Our booking trends that you can see on slide six demonstrate how we continue to experience strong demand for future cruise vacations despite the uncertainties in the broad travel sector, the reduction of demand-generating marketing investments and the temporary absence of a full complement of our all-important travel agent partners. For the second half of 2021, our load factor is below historical ranges, impacted by continued uncertainty around timing of the resumption of cruising and the shift of our limited marketing investments to focus on '22 -- 2022 voyages. Pricing continues to be at [Indecipherable] Level despite the dilutive impact of the value-added future cruise credits for canceled voyages. And while it is still early in the booking cycle, we are very encouraged and very pleased by the strong booking activity, driven by pent-up demand across all three brands for 2022 voyages. Volumes during January and February sequentially improved by over 40% from November and December 2020. And as an added bonus, over 80% of these bookings were new cash bookings. For the first half of 2022 and for all of 2022, in fact, our load factor is currently well ahead of prepandemic levels with pricing at each of our award-winning brands in line to up mid-single digits when excluding the dilutive impacts of future crew certificates. The consumer appetite for global travel aboard our 28 vessels is so strong that even with limited marketing investments, we are yielding outsized results, and we are experiencing record demand with our launches for our future itineraries and global voyage collections. A case in point is Oceania Cruises' 2023 World Cruise, which sold out within one day of opening for sale to the general public. In addition to our loyal pass guests, approximately 1/3 of all bookings for this group came from first-time new-to-brand guests. We believe this achievement, along with multiple booking records we have announced in recent months, demonstrates the pent-up demand that exists from our mature and affluent cruisers even for long and exotic voyages once the severe impact of the pandemic subsides. This demand, coupled with the opening of voyages for sale further in advance, has also resulted in a significant expansion to the booking curve during the fourth quarter, which is now double versus the same time last year. I'll be back later to provide closing remarks. But for now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark for a financial update. Mark? ","Thank you, Frank. My remarks today will focus on the continued execution of our COVID-19 action plan as well as our road map to relaunch. The global pandemic continues to evolve, and we continue to focus on what we can control and we are prepared to adapt and modify our strategy as needed. slide seven illustrates three focus areas of our action plan and the additional proactive measures taken since the beginning of the fourth quarter. First, we have reduced operating expenses and capital expenditures through a number of initiatives, including the further reduction or deferral of near-term marketing expenses, reduction of nonessential capital expenditures, extended salary reductions and furloughs for shoreside team members. In fact, we reduced capital expenditures by approximately 60% for each of the years 2020 and 2021. In addition, we finalized the deferral of EUR220 million of newbuilding-related shipyard payments through the end of the first quarter 2022. Second, we have also made significant progress on improving our debt maturity profile in order to provide additional near-term financial flexibility through the following actions. We amended our Pride of America, Norwegian Jewel and senior secured credit facilities to suspend testing of certain covenants. This covenant relief extends through maturity for the Pride of America and Jewel facilities and through year-end 2022 for the senior secured credit facility. We were also able to defer $70 million of amortization payments due prior to June 30, 2022, for the senior secured credit facility. Second, we secured deferrals for approximately $680 million of our export credit agency-backed amortization payments, representing 100% of our ECA payments originally due through the first quarter of 2022. We also received covenant waivers through the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 on our ECA facilities. We have tremendous support behind us from our strong, long-standing relationships with our export credit agencies, SACE and Hermes, our ECA and commercial lenders as well as the shipyard. Their assistance is playing a significant role in our ability to weather this pandemic, and we can't thank them enough for their continued and ongoing partnership during these unprecedented times. The final focus area of our action plan was securing additional capital. In the fourth quarter, we executed two highly successful transactions. In November, we raised $824 million of net proceeds through an equity offering of 40 million ordinary shares. And in December, we issued 850 million of five 7/8% senior unsecured notes due 2026 in an oversubscribed offering. To date, we've accessed the capital markets five times over a nine-month period. As a result, since the onset of the pandemic, we raised incremental cash of nearly $6.5 billion, including the drawdown of the $875 million revolver early last year. This tremendous accomplishment would not have been possible without the hard work of our finance, treasury, legal and accounting teams who have worked tirelessly around the clock to execute on these initiatives. We have also experienced an incredible outpouring of support from our investors. And again, we can't thank you enough for having conviction in our business model, in our management team and in the long-term potential of our company. slide eight outlines the improvement of our debt maturity profile in response to the crisis. Since the third quarter, we secured debt amortization deferrals of approximately $750 million, resulting in minimal debt service payments for the remainder of 2021. Turning to liquidity. slide nine provides our current illustrative liquidity profile. Our total liquidity as of year-end was approximately $3.2 billion, which includes the portion of customer deposit refunds that are included in accounts payable at quarter end. We have also estimated approximately $300 million for anticipated health and safety investments and other collateral obligations. While we anticipate variability in our health and safety investments as we work through the various requirements and continuously improve and refine our protocols, we wanted to earmark this investment in our illustrative liquidity profile. These factors combined result in a net liquidity on a pro forma basis of approximately $2.9 billion, enabling us to continue to navigate through this fluid environment and execute on our return to service plan. As for cash burn, our team continues to work day in and day out to further reduce expenses and conserve cash. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have made significant progress in reducing our controllable cash burn rate, with the low watermark representing a nearly 80% reduction in cruise operating expenses versus normalized levels. For the fourth quarter, our average monthly cash burn rate was approximately $190 million. This included approximately $15 million per month due to additional expenses related to preparing vessels for a potential return to service in early 2021 and included a limited increase in associated marketing investments, as Frank discussed earlier. As for the first quarter, we expect the average cash burn to temporarily remain elevated at approximately $190 million per month or approximately $170 million per month, excluding nondebt recurring -- nonrecurring debt modification costs as we ramp down our relaunch-related expenses and repatriate crew. The approximately $60 million of onetime costs we incurred in the quarter is a result of debt deferrals and covenant waivers and suspensions, which when combined with the newbuild payment extensions, have resulted in approximately $1 billion of additional liquidity over the next 12 months. Once the ramp down of relaunch-related expenses, including crew repatriation efforts are complete, we expect that the average cash burn rate to decrease and remain at reduced levels until return to service preparations resume. We will continue to take a thoughtful and disciplined approach to reintroducing costs as we resume voyages in order to conserve cash, while at the same time, balance the need to drive new cash bookings. Turning to SLIDE10. We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $3.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash balance in the fourth quarter increased, driven by approximately $1.7 billion of net proceeds from capital raises and was partially offset by approximately $570 million of operating cash burn, which includes operating expenses, SG&A, interest and capex, customer cash refunds for canceled voyages of approximately $120 million and net working capital and other outflows of approximately $20 million, which includes health and safety investments. Given the continued uncertainty around the timing of our voyage resumption, we are not yet prepared to provide guidance on all metrics. However, we have provided guidance on depreciation and amortization, interest expense and newbuild-related capital expenditures to assist with modeling, which can be found in our earnings release and on Slide 19 of the presentation. Broadly speaking, excluding newbuild-related capital expenditures, we still expect the minimum required capital expenditures needed to run the business and maintain our best-in-class fleets is generally a few hundred million dollars per year. Before handing the call back, I want to reemphasize that while we are prioritizing our immediate business needs, we are also very focused on the future of our company. Our medium- and long-term financial recovery plan, which is provided on Slide 11, focuses on three critical components: first, rebuild and gradually return to pre-COVID margin levels while continuing to identify opportunities to further drive margin expansion; second, maximize our cash generation; and third, focus on optimizing our balance sheet and charting a path to delever. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank to provide closing commentary. Frank? ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/26/norwegian-cruise-line-holdings-ltd-nclh-q4-2020-ea/
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) Q4 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 20, 2020","Thank you Andrea. And good morning everyone. We have a lot of ground to cover today, and we fully understand that there is one topic on top of everyone's mind. So while we will address the coronavirus outbreak in detail, I will begin my commentary first with a brief overview of our record 2019 financial results, after which I will turn to 2020 and discuss the impacts of the outbreak. We aim to be as transparent as possible, but with the virus situation as fluid as it is and with so many unknowns at this time, please understand that there may be questions you have, to which we simply will not be able to give you definitive answers to. So let's begin. The 2019 storyline for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings can be best described in one single word, resilience, a theme that will surely carry over into 2020 as we confront the effects of the virus outbreak. Focusing on just 2019 and with headwinds from the southern cessation of cruises to Cuba and the impact of Hurricane Dorian, the year that just ended allowed us to demonstrate, once again, the strength and resilience of our business model. A model founded on operating three award-winning global brands in each of the industry's major categories, a focus on sourcing the best guests from around the world, but anchored in North America consistently diversifying our deployments and quickly redeploying vessels as needed, depending on market conditions and our go-to-market strategy of emphasizing value over price as the main lever to drive demand. Despite these headwinds, the company still delivered record financial results which reflect a doubling over the last five years of revenue to approximately $6.5 billion, adjusted EBITDA, approaching $2 billion and adjusted earnings per share reaching an all-time high and above the $5 mark for the first time in our company's history. In addition, our strong cash generation enabled us to return meaningful levels of capital to our shareholders during the year. Aside from the strong financial results, 2019 was also a year of notable achievements, many of which strengthened the foundation for our future growth. Slide 4 highlights our top 10 milestones of 2019. This past fall, we took delivery of Norwegian Encore, the Norwegian brand's newest, largest and most innovated -- innovative ship to date. We have received the best feedback ever for a new ship production, generating over 2.4 billion positive media impressions. In addition, you should know that Encore is the best booked, highest priced ship ever introduced in the Caribbean market in the Norwegian brand's history. In addition to exciting additions to the fleet, 2019 also brought excitement and enhancements to Great Stirrup Cay, our private island in the Bahamas. We recently unveiled Silver Cove, our new upscale oceanfront lagoon on the island and the initial reception from guests has been phenomenal. This industry-first exclusive oceanfront luxury enclave includes 38 air-conditioned private beachfront villas, a Mandara spa with full-service beachfront treatments as well as the exclusive Moet & Chandon Bar. The addition of Silver Cove adds an exclusive and luxurious element to complement the pristine beaches, water sport activities, action adventure attractions and other amenities available on the island. 2019 also saw exciting new build orders for the Oceania and Regent brands. Oceania Cruises announced an order for two new 1,200 berthed ships that will add to brand's fleet in 2022 and 2025. And meanwhile, Regent Seven Seas Cruises announced an order for a third vessel in its successful Explorer class for delivery in 2023. Now turning to 2020. We find ourselves in an environment where the resilience of our business model will be tested once again by the noncontrollable external factors. The effects of the coronavirus outbreak on our business has been swift and severe, and the continuous global headline news coverage has been substantial and unrelentless. I'd now like to take you through a brief description and chronology of events prior to and during the outbreak and how these events align with booking patterns so far this year. Prior to the emergence of the virus, 2020 was shaping up to be an incredibly good year, without question another record year in a string of record years. We entered 2020 in a record book position at all three brands and at higher prices on a comparable basis. This strong book position further improved during the early stages of Wave as both the volume and pricing of bookings accelerated with all three brands experiencing very strong booking volumes at higher prices through late January. We have provided 2020 full-year guidance excluding impacts of the virus that were commensurate with the strength we were experiencing entering the year and during the early part of Wave. Our adjusted earnings per share for full-year 2020 was expected to be in the range of $5.40 to $5.60 with net yield growth in the range of 2% to 3%, and we were on track to achieving our full speed ahead 2020 targets. The virus' initial impact of the cruise industry began with the cancellation of a number of sailings by operators who had ships dedicated to the Chinese market and with sales from Chinese ports. With zero capacity dedicated to the Chinese source market and with only approximately 10 basis points of our global sourcing coming from China, the impact on our brands was deemed to be minimal at the time. Concerns then extended very quickly to include 10 Asian voyages that originated outside of China, but that called on Chinese ports. While these itineraries were quickly modified to avoid or bypass Chinese ports and were replaced with Asian ports of call outside of China, trepidation by American and other western consumers resulted in increased cancellations and a slowdown in new bookings for sailings in the region. As the outbreak intensified into February, and countries throughout Southeast Asia, refused to allow the docking of cruise ships on their shores, more drastic itinerary modifications were necessary including the cancellation of certain sailings. Subsequent negative news coverage greatly intensified. And unfortunately, the cruise industry drew much of the media's focus primarily due to the quarantine of a competitor's cruise vessel in Japan. At this point, a broader and more meaningful slowdown in new bookings and an increase in cancellations began to develop for sailings outside of Asia. Since the outbreak began, we have taken several aggressive and proactive measures to assure the safety, security and well-being of our guests and crew by implementing strict embarkation and screening protocols for guests and crew that meet or exceed cleanup mandated standards across our fleet which includes denying embarkation to any guess or crew member that has visited mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau in the 30 days prior to embarkation. Along with these and other health and safety precautions, we have also taken proactive steps to reduce our exposure to Asia. In an abundance of caution and due to the uncertainties surrounding port entry and berthing availability in destinations throughout the region, and most importantly because our book guests and potential new customers are currently reluctant to travel to and sail in and around Asia, we have canceled or modified the remainder of our voyages in the region across our three brands through the end of the third quarter. These cancellations and modifications comprised 40 voyages in all: 10 for the Oceania Cruises brand, six for Regent Seven Seas Cruises and 24 for Norwegian Cruise Line, 21 of which are for the Norwegian Spirit which will reposition from Asia and be redeployed to the Eastern Mediterranean. While Spirit will have an extremely condensed booking window ahead of our first sailings, we believe that given the unknown duration and severity of the situation, this deployment change provides us with the best opportunity to max our revenue and earnings potential, given the circumstances and once again demonstrates our company's nimbleness and flexibility to quickly redeploy assets as necessary. This redeployment in the aforementioned cancellations of other voyages leaves us with zero capacity in Asia through the third quarter. In the near term, and as of this call, due to the direct impact of the virus on our business which includes guest refunds and incentive compensation stemming from itinerary modifications and voyage cancellations and the redeployment of Norwegian spirit to Europe with a shortened booking window, we expect a direct impact to 2020 adjusted earnings per share of approximately $0.75 per share. Please note that given the unknown duration and severity of the outbreak, there may be additional direct impacts that are not yet quantifiable as well as material indirect impact affecting the broader global consumer demand environment and which ] extend to our global deployments outside of Asia which cannot be quantified at this time. Based on the known direct impact of $0.75 per share and the yet unknown and unquantifiable potential additional direct and/or indirect financial impacts from the virus, we no longer anticipate achieving our full speed ahead 2020 targets by year-end. While we are withdrawing our targets, we want to be clear that we remain committed to their fundamental tenants of growing return on invested capital and earnings per share, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning meaningful capital to shareholders. There are, however, some silver linings in the immediate and near-term that point to the underlying resilience of our business and the potential for a reasonably timed recovery. First is that our book of business entering the year was so strong that adjusted for the redeployment of Norwegian Spirit, our book position and pricing remains slightly ahead of this time last year on a comparable basis. This strong book position demonstrates a strong demand and fundamentals of our business, the volume of our advanced bookings and the potential for outsized returns when business comes back to normal. Second, onboard revenue per sailings outside of Asia continued to perform above last year's record levels and better than our current year expectations demonstrating that any consumer concerns does not extend once guests are on-board. Third, the sale of future cruises onboard to guests currently sailing continue to exceed both prior-year record levels and current expectations. And lastly and perhaps most importantly, in the previous five days, we have seen an improvement in week-over-week booking volumes and a decrease in cancellations when compared to the prior three weeks. And while I do not want to conclude any definitive turnaround trend just yet, given the relatively short time period being analyzed, it is at least one data point of a possible positive change. As an industry and as a company, we have faced and overcome challenges similar to COVID-19 in the past and I am confident that this challenge will be no different. From past experience of similar events, it usually takes 8-plus weeks from the time the new cycle peaks to when we can expect consumers return to normal purchasing patterns, and we remain confident that it's not a matter of if this will occur, but a matter of when. For further proof, I refer you to Slide 7 in our earnings presentations. For as long as many of us have been in or have followed the cruise industry, more people cruise in any given year than the year proceeding it despite geopolitical and macroeconomic events that have occurred around the world. Ours is as resilient an industry as there is. And I believe this virus outbreak will be another example that the industry will overcome. I'll be back at the end of the call for some final words. But for now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark for a review of results and guidance. Mark? ","Thank you Frank. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2019 and 2018 net yield and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day metrics on a constant currency basis. In addition, unless otherwise noted, 2020 guidance figures exclude any direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. We continue to monitor this situation and its potential impact to our results. I'll begin with commentary on our fourth quarter and full-year results followed by our 2020 outlook. As you can see on Slide 8, strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter driven by strong pricing for close-in bookings and better-than-expected onboard revenue drove earnings above expectations with adjusted EPS of $0.73, beating guidance by $0.04, inclusive of the previously disclosed $0.09 impact from Hurricane Dorian and $0.04 of headwinds from foreign exchange rates. Focusing on the top line, net yield growth was 1.8% in the fourth-quarter outperforming guidance of flat to prior year. This is inclusive of approximately 110 basis point drag from Hurricane Dorian. If not for the 440 basis point impact from both Cuba and Dorian, as shown on Slide 9, net yield growth in the quarter would have reached 6.2%, demonstrating the strength of our core top-line fundamentals. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel, increased 4% versus prior year and 3.4% on an as-reported basis. Costs were higher than guidance primarily driven by increase in marketing and other investments. Fuel expense for the quarter was slightly higher than expectations due to an increase in fuel price per metric ton net of hedges which came in at $508 versus guidance of $498. Turning to the full-year results. 2019 finished strong, and we delivered yet another year of record financial performance despite significant external headwinds. Revenue net yield and adjusted earnings per share were all the highest in our company's history. Looking at Slide 10. Full-year adjusted earnings per share was $5.09, beating November guidance by $0.04. This beat was inclusive of the $0.04 foreign exchange headwind previously noted. Outperformance in the top line from continued strong demand for our portfolio of products also contributed to the earnings beat. Revenue grew 6.7% over prior year on capacity of 2.1%, reaching a record $6.5 billion. To put our performance in perspective, I'll refer you to Slide 11. If not for the $0.67 of headwinds from Cuba, Dorian and Pearl, our adjusted EPS would have reached $5.76, well ahead of our initial February guidance of $5.20 to $5.30. This would have represented a 17% increase in adjusted EPS versus prior year. Other key financial metrics for the full-year 2019 include net yield growth of 3.6% or 2.9% on an as-reported basis which exceeded our November guidance by 60 basis points. If not for the 200 basis point headwind from Cuba, Pearl and Dorian net yield would have been 5.6%. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel increased 6.2% or 5.5% on an as-reported basis. And fuel price per metric ton net of hedges increased to $491 million from $483 in the prior year. Shifting to 2020, as Frank mentioned earlier, the COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in direct and indirect impacts on our operations including the modification and cancellation of certain sailings as well as reduced booking activity over the last several weeks. Our 2020 capacity prior to the canceled voyages, was expected to increase approximately 8.9% due to the addition of Norwegian Encore last November and the introduction of Seven Seas Splendor this month. Post the canceled sailings, our capacity growth is expected to be approximately 8.1%. I'll direct you to Slide 12 to review some deployment highlights. Note these deployment figures include impacts in connection with the COVID-19 outbreak. The main highlights include an expected decrease in Caribbean capacity versus prior year as two ships that were originally sailing to Cuba were redeployed out of the region. Europe capacity is expected to be up almost 30%, as we deploy additional ships to the region in the peak summer season, as well as the 21 redeployed Norwegian Spirit sailings. Alaska has been a key market, and we've strategically increased our presence through both destination development initiatives and increased capacity with the introduction of new innovative hardware to the region. Our capacity is expected to be up approximately 20% and primarily due to the addition of a fourth Norwegian ship to the market, Norwegian Sun which offers destination-intensive seven to 15-day itineraries from Seattle. Asia capacity is expected to be down low to mid-teens which factors in the 40 voyages that were recently modified or canceled including the 21 redeployed Norwegian Spirit sailings. The entire Asia, Africa, Pacific region now comprises just 5% of our deployment mix for the year. First-quarter deployment is similar to prior year, as it is the most Caribbean centric quarter with over 60% of our capacity deployed in the market. Looking at expectations for the full-year 2020 on Slide 13, we are providing guidance excluding direct and indirect impacts from COVID-19. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.40 to $5.60. This guidance includes capital allocation as part of our full speed ahead 2020 targets which we have now withdrawn. Given the uncertainty around the duration and extent of this outbreak we will evaluate our capital allocation strategy quarter to quarter. To date, the current direct adjusted EPS impact of COVID-19 is approximately $0.75 per share and is almost all comprised of lost revenue from a total of 40 canceled, modified or redeployed sailings in Asia through the end of the third quarter across our three brands. This includes 10 canceled sailings, eight of which are on our -- hot on Regent and Oceania brands which garner yields well above the corporate average. As well as the close end redeployment of the 21 Asia sailings to the Eastern Med on Norwegian Spirit that have an extremely condensed booking window. The virus situation is extremely fluid, and while we expect additional direct and indirect impacts, it is simply too early to quantify potential broader headwinds to the business resulting from softer global demand for travel and tourism. Net yields for the year is expected to increase in the range of 2% to 3% on both a constant and as-reported basis. This performance is on top of the strong growth we delivered in 2019 of 3.6%. This guidance excludes approximately 300 basis points of known direct coronavirus impact primarily weighted to the first half of the year. Moving on to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel, is expected to be up approximately 1.25% on both a constant and reported basis. The increase is primarily due to higher total dry dock days and associated costs versus prior year and includes two extended 40-plus day dry docks for Norwegian Spirit in the first quarter and Pride of America in the second quarter. As well as technology and other investments aimed at process improvement to support our future growth. Focusing on the fuel environment on Slide 14. IMO 2020 regulations are now in effect resulting in a shift in MGO consumption from approximately 30% in 2019, to approximately 60% in 2020 which is in line with our previous expectations. This coupled with an increase in consumption resulting from capacity growth is driving fuel expense higher versus prior year. We anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $560 with expected consumption of approximately 885,000 metric tons. Fuel expense is slightly higher than expectations provided in November due to an increase in at the pump pricing. There are a few key items to keep in mind for the balance of 2020. Due to the fluid nature of the impact from the outbreak, cadence may shift throughout the year. What we can share right now is our expectation that the first and second quarters will have the largest direct COVID-19 impacts primarily resulting from the canceled modified or redeployed sailings. Net yield growth is still expected to be lower in the first half of the year primarily due to tough pricing comparisons from Cuba sailings in 2019. We expect net yield growth for the second quarter to be the lowest yield growth quarter as a result of tough Cuba comps, the 40-plus day dry docks in the high-yielding -- of the high-yielding Pride of America, and the incremental capacity days associated with Norwegian Joy versus prior year where she was out of service during her dry dock and repositioning to Alaska. Now let's take a look at our expectations for the first quarter which exclude any impact from COVID-19 which can be found on Slide 15. Net yield is expected to increase approximately 0.25 point or flat on an as-reported basis. And adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately four and a half percet or four and a quarter percent on a reported basis. We anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $602 with expected consumption of approximately 232,000 metric tons. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EPS for the first quarter is expected to be approximately $0.48. In terms of the impact from COVID-19, we expect that of the $0.75 known direct impact for the year, approximately $0.25 will fall into the first quarter which equates to a 450 basis point impact on net yield growth. Before returning the call to Frank, I want to reiterate that coming into the year and through its first few weeks, our core business fundamentals were solid as ever, and we were well on our way to another record year. While the current environment is temporarily impacting our business. The team at Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings is working tirelessly to do what is right for our guests, crew and shareholders while protecting the equity of our brands. We believe in our business model which has demonstrated its resilience time and time, again. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank to provide closing commentary.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) Q3 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 07, 2019","Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. There are a few important parallel between the second and third quarters of 2019 that I'd like to point out. First, the third quarter, like the second, marked another record-setting quarter for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings as we posted not only the highest quarterly revenue in our history, but also the company's highest ever quarterly net yield. At nearly $301 per day, the third quarter marked the first time net yield has ever surpassed the $300 mark, not just for our company, but for any of the major cruise operators. Even more impressive is that the record revenue and record net yield came in a quarter in which we experienced a 1.8% decrease in capacity days. Also, like the second quarter, the third quarter benefited from a continued strong demand environment that once again proved that the consumer, especially the North American consumer, is alive and well. And lastly, both quarters benefited from our strategic initiatives around itinerary optimization, particularly in Alaska and Europe, where we grew capacity in the quarter by 17% and 13%, respectively. Also, similar to what we experienced in the second quarter, we overcame external and noncontrollable headwinds, both known headwinds and new ones, demonstrating once again the resilience of our business model and the power of the go-to-market strategy utilized by our big global brands. One of the primary goals of this call is to once again cut through the noise and put in perspective the impact of these short-term disruptions and provide you with a clear picture of how we see our core business performing going forward. So in the third quarter, we delivered another record-setting quarter with strong financial performance and bottom-line results that would have been even stronger if not for the following events. First, and as covered in our prior earnings call, was the impact from the abrupt cessation of sailings to Cuba. Given the steadiness of the termination and the lack of lead time we had to make any meaningful fleet redeployment changes, the third quarter bears the largest negative earnings impact from the Cuba travel ban. In this case, $0.22 per share. The Cuba impact thankfully diminishes over time, beginning in this year's fourth quarter and onward through the second quarter of 2020 as we lap the canceled Cuba sailings and redeployed vessels that would have sailed to Cuba to other premium-yielding itineraries, including Alaska, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Southeast Asia. The second event was the previously disclosed technical issue on Norwegian Pearl that occurred in early July and which disrupted approximately one month of premium priced peak summer sailings in Europe, resulting in an impact of $0.07 per share. And third, and most recently, was the impact stemming from Hurricane Dorian, which cost several voyage disruption and the cancellation of two voyages during the quarter and was a drag to earnings of $0.06 per share. I'm extremely proud of how our team members rose to the occasion in the aftermath of Dorian and came together not only to assist our valued guests, but also the citizens of the Bahamas, most affected by the ravages of the storm. With a 50-plus year relationship that goes back to the early days of modern cruise industry, the path of Norwegian Cruise Line and the Bahamas are forever linked, which is why we responded as quickly and as generously as we could to relaunch our Hope Starts Here hurricane relief campaign to gather and transport relief supplies, as well as collect monetary donations from team members, travel partners, concerned guests, and others. In less than one month and due to the overwhelming outpouring of support, we were able to increase our commitment to $3 million, including a $2 million cash contribution, coupled with approximately $1 million in supplies to assist All Hand and Hearts with emergency respond aid across the Bahamas, including debris cleanup, and removal and the rebuilding of community infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools in Freeport and the Abaco Islands. Slide 4 shows a summary of this aid. And while the immediate response was important in bringing relief to the affected areas, just as important was our extended support by resuming sailings to the Bahamas as soon as possible and bringing tens of thousands of guests, particularly to Nassau and our private island at Great Stirrup Cay. While the end of voyages to Cuba and the technical issue on Pearl were previously taken into account in our guidance for the third quarter, impact from Dorian laid some unforeseen obstacles to achieving our guided results. But achieve them we did, and then some, by delivering earnings that once again exceeded guidance this time by $0.08 per share, and which if not for the impact from Dorian, would have outperformed guidance by $0.14 per share. This extraordinary performance demonstrates once again the strong and resilient earnings capabilities of our business model, which, combined with the excellent results stemming from premium peak season markets such as Alaska and Europe, helped our company exceed expectations and deliver once again both the highest ticket and the highest onboard yields in the industry and by a wide margin. Our performance in high-yielding Alaska was bolstered by the addition of the better than new Norwegian Joy, joining her record-setting sister ship, Norwegian Bliss, to form the cornerstone of our sizable deployment strategy in this growing and very profitable region. In the coming years, we will further bolster our presence and commitment to the region on two fronts: first, with additional capacity, operating sailings that offers longer, more port immersive and unique itineraries, which complement our current seven-day deployments; and second, through the development of key port infrastructure and guest-facing revenue-generating projects, which will expand and enhance our guest experience, and that I will discuss in more detail later in my remarks.Meanwhile, our sailings in Europe benefited from our global sourcing model and our go-to-market strategy that allows us to source the best or highest-yielding guest regardless of their providence. To drive this point home, while North Americans comprise the majority of our guest sourcing for Europe area sailing, it's important to note that the second largest contingent of sourced guests for these itineraries do not come from locally sourced European, but from the rest of the world, including Australia, Asia, and South America. And that's a very important differentiator for us because we know that a guest that flies long distances to boarding ship is a higher-yielding guests that one that drives their car or takes a bus or train to the port of embarkation. But in spite of Europe's well-publicized issues, including Brexit and the weakening German and Italian economies, booked ticket revenue for the Norwegian brand's European sailings from European source guests has actually increased by a whopping 43% since the introduction of the Free at Sea offering seven months ago, which has obviously resonated extremely well with our target markets and our travel agent partners. As for the Caribbean, it's really a tale of two stories. First, demand for core Caribbean sailings, both for western and eastern deployment, remains strong with low in pricing ahead of same time last year across our three brands and extending well into 2020. And as I stressed last quarter, and will, again now, we have not seen, and quite frankly, do not expect to see any deterioration in the overall demand dynamics for the greater Caribbean. If anything, we have seen an acceleration of overall demand over the last four to six weeks, including demand for Caribbean sailings, which has resulted in our year-over-year load factor and book revenue lead to increase over this period. Second, the vast majority of the canceled Cuba voyages from the Norwegian brand, which were by necessity, converted to short Bahamas intensive sailings and which were already impacted by a much shortened booking window, faced additional headwinds from the impact of Dorian. But the headwinds from Cuba, and especially Dorian, are short-lived in nature and will sequentially diminish as we approach the lapping of the Cuba regulation change as the booking window for short Bahamas sailing expands to normal time frames, and as certain ships formerly sailing to Cuba and now solely sailing to the Bahamas, reposition to more premium destinations later in 2020, thus reducing capacity from this historically lower-yielding destination. The core Caribbean will always be a critical region in our deployment strategy as it has been for over 50 years since the first Norwegian cruise on ship began offering cruises from Miami. And this strategy will continue as we launch Norwegian Encore, the brand's newest, largest and most innovative ship to date and the first new ship launched by the brand at Caribbean in four years. We took delivery of Encore just last week, and reports from her inaugural activities in Europe have been both stellar and more effusive than we could have had expected. The word encore can be defined as a reappearance or additional performances demanded by an audience for which artists or performers usually save their best material. If that's indeed the definition, the Norwegian Encore fully embodies her name as for features are indeed a collection of the best of the Breakaway Plus Class. As these vessels enter the fleet, each included new and exciting features, including the first go cart racetrack at sea, the debut of the virtual reality pack Galaxy Pavilion and the stunning observation lounge that made Norwegian Joy and Bliss perfect ship for Alaska cruising. At Norwegian Encore, we have expanded elevated and enhanced these features and added new ones, including the introduction of a new upscale dining concept, Onda by Scarpetta. Collectively, these features are one of the reasons why Encore is the best booked, highest priced Caribbean-introduced ship in Norwegian's history and by a wide margin. And another reason for Encore's success is the continued refinement in broad consumer acceptance of the Free at Sea marketing campaign, which has become the cornerstone of the Norwegian brand's go-to-market bundle strategy of focusing consumers on value versus price. On the heels of Encore will be the delivery of Seven Seas Splendor in January of 2020 for the Regent Seven Seas Cruises brand. As you can see on Slide 5, Splendor fully embraces her tag line of luxury perfected, which has resonated extremely well with both the brand's large contingent of loyal pass guests and target new ones. The halo effect from Splendor is impressive. For 2020, the Regent brand like sister brand, Oceania Cruises, is already nearly 70% booked and at higher prices versus same time last year despite Regent's 26% increase in capacity, demonstrating the brand's continued track record of profitably absorbing new capacity. Splendor is not only the best booked ship introduction for the Regent brand. She is also the highest-yielding new ship introduction in the company's history. This is not only a big win for the Regent brand, but a big win for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings as it helps extend our formidable dominance in leading the industry in net yield. Both Splendor and Encore are benefiting from being introduced into a strong consumer demand environment, one whether continues to be no sign of a slowdown and with 2020 already shaping up to be another record year, with occupancy and pricing outpacing 2019 record levels across all three brands. You might recall that on our last few earnings calls, I've made mention that booking windows cannot and should not expand forever. But demand for our stellar brands has been so strong, that while we have taken no significant overt action to consciously expand the booking window expanded it by 10% in the third quarter, underscoring consumers' underlying appetite for cruising on our three brands. And further demonstrating the strength of our forward business is the growth of our advanced ticket sales, which increased 12.5% over the prior year on a forward-year capacity increase of only 8.7%. In other words, advanced ticket deposit growth has outstripped capacity growth by approximately 44%. Now I'll be back at the end of the call with some final thoughts. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Mark to review our results for the quarter and our updated expectations for the year in more detail. Mark? ","Thank you, Frank. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2019 and 2018 net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics, on a constant-currency basis. As you can see on Slide 6, strong revenue performance in the third quarter, primarily driven by exceptionally strong onboard revenue and strength in close-in bookings, drove earnings above expectations with adjusted EPS of $2.23, beating our guidance by $0.08 despite a $0.06 impact from Hurricane Dorian. The quarter experienced a direct impact from Dorian from three items. First was the cancellation of two voyages as a result of the extended closure of Port Miami, which forced us to reroute two of our ships, Norwegian Breakaway and Sun, to New Orleans, resulting in lost revenue and additional costs to repatriate guests back home. Second, where multiple itinerary changes, not only for ship sailing from Florida, but for ships operating up and down the Eastern Seaboard as many of the ports were closed as a cautionary measure while awaiting the path of the weather system. And lastly, our hurricane relief efforts, which totaled approximately $3 million. If not for this impact, adjusted EPS would have grown to $2.29 on a decrease in capacity days of 1.8% and would have exceeded our August guidance by $0.14 and the prior year's record of $2.27 despite the impact of Cuba and Pearl. Turning to Slide 7. Net yield increased 3.9% or 3.3% on an as-reported basis versus prior year on a capacity decrease of 1.8%, outperforming guidance expectations by approximately 215 basis points. Stripping out the noise in the quarter, core fundamentals remain strong. And if not for the previously disclosed impacts from Cuba and Pearl, coupled with Dorian, net yield would have increased 6.7%. This growth comes on top of prior year's robust net yield growth of 4%, which included both the benefit of premium priced Cuba sailings and the premium priced inaugural Alaska season for Norwegian Bliss compared to current year, which included lower-priced Bahamas cruises that had to be filled in a very compressed sales cycle. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel, increased 11% versus prior year and 10.2% on an as-reported basis, making Q3 the highest growth quarter in the year, consistent with our expectations. This increase was a result of unanticipated costs due to Dorian such as guest repatriation and costs related to relief efforts, along with incremental marketing to bolster sailings in 2020. Combined with expenses outlined in our prior call, which included the scheduled 18-day dry dock of Oceania's Regatta, marketing expenses for sailings previously containing Cuba calls and operating costs associated with Pearl's technical issue. Fuel expense for the quarter was slightly higher than expectations due to an increase in fuel price per metric ton net of hedges, which came in at $504 versus guidance of $492. Turning to Q4. I'll direct you to Slide 8 to review deployment highlights. As our ships repositioned to their winter deployments, there are two focal markets for the quarter: the Caribbean and Europe. Our Caribbean mix is up approximately 39%, which is down versus prior year, with capacity decreasing approximately 8%, primarily due to the extended European season for deployment of Norwegian Getaway and Epic, along with the addition of Norwegian Pearl to the region. Europe mix for the quarter increased to approximately 18%, representing a nearly 40% increase in capacity as a result of the extended season. Looking at expectations for the fourth quarter on Slide 9. Core business fundamentals are strong despite an expected incremental $0.09 of headwinds driven by lower pricing and higher expenses entirely due to Dorian. Let's focus on net yield first. As a reminder, keep in mind that our Q4 outlook includes the expected dilutive mix impact of approximately 125 basis points for the combined performance of Bliss and Encore in the quarter. Further, this quarter also includes a scheduled dry dock of the highest-yielding ship in the fleet, Regent Seven Seas Explorer. Dorian's 110 basis point drag on net yield as a result of the one-two punch of Cuba sailings being converted to Bahamas-only sailings, combined with the near-term dampening of consumer demand for Bahamas sailings from the extensive media coverage surrounding the storm. That said, the good news is that the pricing impact we are seeing from that is expected to be fully offset in the quarter by strength in the core Caribbean, resulting in an improved outlook for net yield compared to our prior-implied guidance. And as time passes, and we distance ourselves from the impacts of Cuba and Dorian, the booking window will return to normal, and more importantly, half of our capacity in the Bahamas basin will reposition to other higher-yielding destinations such as Alaska beginning in early Q2. To better illustrate the strength of our core top-line fundamentals in the fourth quarter, when you strip out the noise from Cuba, Dorian and the mix impact from the new Norwegian ships, that results in an expected 5.7% increase in net yield over prior-year solid growth of 4.7%, which, as you recall, benefited from the premium priced Cuba sailings and Norwegian Bliss' incredibly successful inaugural Caribbean season. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel, is expected to be up approximately 2.25% or 1.75% on an as-reported basis, which represents an increase of less than 1.5 of 1% on an annual basis. The increase is primarily due to costs to repair damage to our private islands infrastructure and to replenish its various beach fronts as a result of the erosion caused by Dorian. Higher-than-expected dry dock costs required to harmonize Explorer to that of its sister ship Splendor, higher inaugural expenses for the extended launch activities of Norwegian Encore in Europe, New York, and Miami, and slightly higher sales and marketing expenses to further bolster the successful launch of Splendor and support the Regent brand's 26% growth in the year. Looking at fuel expense. We anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $498, with expected consumption of approximately 221,000 metric tons. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $0.69, which includes an estimated impact of $0.26 from Cuba and Dorian. Exclusive of these two items, adjusted EPS guidance would have been $0.95, an increase of approximately 12% over prior year. Turning to the full year. I'll walk you through the components of our revised adjusted EPS outlook on Slide 10. The year benefited from top-line outperformance in the third quarter combined with a stronger revenue outlook for the fourth quarter, primarily in the core Caribbean, resulting in a $0.14 benefit to the full year. Accretion from the 150 million in shares repurchased in the third quarter accounts for $0.03 and foreign exchange, fuel and other savings of approximately $0.03. These benefits were partially offset by the aforementioned marketing and dry dock cost of $0.05 and a $0.15 impact from Dorian, of which $0.10 is attributable to revenue and $0.05 is attributable to costs. As a result, we expect adjusted EPS to be in line with the midpoint of our August guidance of approximately $5.05. To put the year in perspective, if not for the $0.67 of combined headwinds from Cuba, Pearl, and Dorian, our guidance would have been approximately $5.72 or an approximate 16% increase over prior year and would have exceeded the high end of our original guidance range provided at the beginning of the year. Looking at expectations for other key operating metrics on Slide 11. We've increased our outlook for net yield growth for the year by 40 basis points to now be up approximately 3% or 2.4% on an as-reported basis versus August guidance despite the impact from Dorian. If not for this headwind, net yield growth would have increased another 25 basis points to 3.25%. And if not for Cuba and Pearl, as well, net yield growth would have been approximately 5%. Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel, is expected to be up approximately 5.75% or 5% on an as-reported basis. The 125 basis point increase versus previous guidance is primarily due to the impacts from Dorian and the previously mentioned items. Looking at fuel expense. We anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $490 with expected consumption of approximately 836,000 metric tons. Focusing on the fuel environment on Slide 12. We continue to strengthen our hedge program, and during the quarter, increased our overall portfolio. While there is still a small amount of uncertainty in connection with the new IMO regulations going into effect on January 1st, we continue to expect our 2020 total fuel expense net of hedges to be on the higher end of our typical range of 6% to 7% of gross revenue. This is consistent with our previous expectations and is driven by an increase in volume from capacity growth, as well as higher pricing primarily related to the shift in MGO consumption from 30% to approximately 60% in 2020. Looking ahead to the broader outlook for 2020. While it is still too early to provide guidance, we want to provide some puts and takes and a few items to keep in mind. First, regarding Cuba. As Frank mentioned earlier, the impact diminishes in 2020 to the previously disclosed expected range of $0.20 to $0.25 per share for the full year. This impacts the first half of the year in the top line due to the loss of the premium pricing that our Cuba sailings garnered. Second, Norwegian Bliss is lapping her successful inaugural first and second quarter of sailings, stepping down from the pricing premium that inaugural seasons customarily command. Lastly, the accretive benefit to yields from Seven Seas Splendor, which was offset by the expected dilutive impact of Norwegian Encore. And in terms of dry docks, 2020 will have a higher number of dry dock days versus 2019, including two extended dockings of approximately 40 days each for Norwegian Spirit in the first quarter and Pride of America in the second quarter. In terms of the cadence for net yield growth. The aforementioned puts and takes are heavily weighted to the first half, with Cuba alone providing a 200 basis point drag. As a result, first and second-quarter net yield growth is expected to be below the typical range of net yield growth that we normally aim to deliver. All in all, it's steady as she goes, and 2020 is expected to follow in the footsteps of 2019 as another record year. While we have work to do to offset the multiple headwinds we've weathered over the last few quarters, our business fundamentals remain strong, and we continue to be on a solid trajectory toward achieving our full speed ahead 2020 targets that were laid out at our investor day. Focusing on shareholder returns on Slide 13. We took advantage of current valuations and executed $150 million in share repurchases in the third quarter. We have now returned over $1 billion since the beginning of 2018. This represents approximately 9% of our shares outstanding or 19 million shares in total. Of that total, $750 million is related to our full speed ahead 2020 targets and equates to more than half of the midpoint of our capital allocation target under the program of $1 billion to $1.5 billion by the end of 2020. Our board of directors continue to believe that the most efficient way to return capital to our shareholders is through opportunistic share repurchases. As such, and until the market valuations begin to reflect the proper value of our company, we will continue to use this method as the primary vehicle to return capital. Our goal is to eventually have a more balanced approach to capital allocation, and we will continue to evaluate the potential implementation of a dividend with our board. As for the balance sheet, as you can see on Slide 14, it continues to strengthen, and we have rapidly delevered since the acquisition of Prestige in 2014 by nearly four turns, with net leverage at approximately three times at the end of the quarter. By year-end, we expect leverage to modestly elevate primarily due to the debt associated with the delivery of Norwegian Encore where we have little or no earnings benefit in the quarter. Excluding that debt, leverage is expected to be approximately three times at year-end. We expect our net leverage to continue to decline over the next four quarters primarily through strong earnings generation and scheduled debt amortization. Before turning the call back to Frank, I'd like to discuss one metric we feel is vastly underappreciated, our cash generation. Despite operating in an extremely capital-intensive industry, coupled with our strong growth profile, our cash generation is expected to accelerate as we continue to realize the powerful earnings accretion our core business model provides, as well as the incremental earnings power from the addition of Norwegian Encore and Seven Seas Splendor to the fleet. This positive cash generation provides us the flexibility to continue to return meaningful capital to shareholders while also making prudent investments for the future to further enhance returns. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank to provide closing commentary. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/11/07/norwegian-cruise-line-holdings-nclh-q3-2019-earnin.aspx
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) Q2 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 08, 2019","Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. For those that have followed our company and the industry over the years, the second quarter of 2019 was certainly one that will be long remembered. In the case of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, the quarter will be remembered for our strategic itinerary optimization initiative, which included our entry into the new European home ports and the launch of our largest Alaska deployment to date, with Norwegian Joy making her North American debut and joining her incredibly successful sister ship, Norwegian Bliss, in sailing to the last frontier. The North American launch of Norwegian Joy was a runaway success generating over 2.5 billion media impression and further elevating Norwegian Cruise Line's already preeminent position in the all-important growing and high-yielding Alaska market. But in the long run, the quarter will be primarily remembered with the challenges brought on by the closure of a popular destination that became inaccessible to us and to the industry literally overnight. What the ebbs and flows of the quarter this clearly demonstrate is the resilience of our industry and particularly of our company and that of our three award-winning brands and our ability to react quickly and effectively to a fast-changing sea space. Among the goal for today's call is to provide you with a clear and precise view of our post-Cuba business and highlight the many reasons why our core business fundamentals remains strong or stronger than ever. We'll start with the change in the regulation that resulted in the end of cruises to Cuba. If you recall in 2017, our company became the first cruise operator to have all of its brand approved to sail for the island. And in 2019, Norwegian Sky was the penultimate to depart from Havana as revised federal regulation from the Department of Treasury and Commerce effectively put an end to voyages to Cuba from U.S. ports. And while only 4% of our full-year 2019 deployment included calls to Cuba, the impact of losing this destination was outsized given the makeup of the voyages that we offer there. These voyages range from single-day calls to Havana typically by the Norwegian brand to more Cuba-intensive itineraries, which visited up to three Cuban ports on our Oceania and Regent brands. Based on these later voyages in which our brands had an outsized share that resulted in the cruise ban having a disproportionately larger impact in our company versus other industry participants. While all Cuba-inclusive voyages enjoyed very strong demand and pricing premiums of at least 25% more than that of a similar but non-Cuba-inclusive voyages, the sailings that featured Cuba-intensive itineraries had a much longer booking curve, meaning that guests booked on average nine to 12 months in advance of the sail date, resulting in the effect of sailings being sold out at very high prices well into Q1 of 2020. In addition, the discounts we offered as an inducement for guests to remain on the revised voyages and not cancel were generous. Lastly, and in spite of the 50% refund that constituted the generous offer, these sailings experienced a significantly higher level of cancellation, oftentimes reaching an excess of 80% of booking, as the star attraction of this itinerary, which were multiple calls to Cuban ports, many of which included overnight stays simply could not be replicated by going elsewhere. And while we were ready for a possible cruise ban to Cuba, we were not, quite frankly, ready for the ban to take effect with only 12 hours advance notice. Nevertheless, teams across our three brands did an incredible job in reacting quickly to comply with the new regulations while making guests and travel agent partners whole, so to speak, for the loss of this highly sought-after destination, providing itinerary alternatives both in the near and long term and creating new itineraries and even completely new deployments for affected vessels. For the two new Norwegian vessels sailings to Cuba, 2019 itineraries were modified to now include Freeport and/or Nassau in place of Havana while continuing to call on Great Stirrup Cay, our private island destination in the Bahamas and our highest rated port of call. In summer of 2020, Norwegian Sun will instead deploy to Alaska, offering destination-intensive seven- to 15-day itineraries from Seattle, giving us a smaller vessel with longer, more immersive itinerary in this high-yielding market and leaving summer Bahamas short cruises to the newly refurbished Norwegian Sky. We believe the Norwegian Sun Alaska deployment will generate yields that will approach, if not be equal to, what she was commanding in her Cuba deployment, led by strong onboard spending. Oceania Cruises, which was operating the majority of the Cuban-intensive sailing, converted its fourth-quarter 2019 and first-quarter 2020 Cuba program into Eastern and Western Caribbean voyages. For the second half of 2020, the brand extended its strong yielding fall Mediterranean season and complemented it with the creation of a new and exotic collection of sailing to the Eastern Med, including calls to Turkey and the Holy Land, the Arabian Peninsula and into Southeast Asia. Lastly, Regent, which had the least exposure to Cuba of our three brands, converted its View 2020 Cuba program with additional sailings to South America, the Panama Canal and Bermuda. Now there has been some concern and much speculation about a weakening of general Caribbean demand and capacity oversupply to the region as a result of the Cuba cruise ban. I want to stress here today that we have not seen and quite frankly do not expect to see in the coming quarter any deterioration in the overall demand dynamic for the Greater Caribbean Basin resulting from ship redeployment stemming from the Cuba cruise ban nor are we seeing, nor expect to see deteriorating pricing. As mentioned earlier, Cuba was first and foremost a very small percentage of our company and of the industry's deployments. The substitute itineraries have, for the most part, remained within the Bahamas sphere of operation with Nassau and Freeport substituting Havana, or as just explained, deployed to a totally new area. In fact, demand for our core 2019 Caribbean sailings remains strong with low in-pricing ahead of the same time last year across our three brands and extending well into 2020. And while the regulations that brought an end to cruises to Cuba have indeed had a negative impact on our financial results, the fundamentals of our business remain as solid as they have ever been. This is first demonstrated by our strong second-quarter results, which, excluding the impact to Cuba, exceeded our already high expectations driven by strong pricing growth and a consumer hell-bent on breaking all previous onboard spend records and the continuing trend to purchase their next cruise while still onboard. Looking forward, our company has a suite of attributes from which meaningful long-term benefits are being derived. For example, we continue to benefit from our proven and established business model, the cornerstone of which was a strict focus on flawlessly operating competitive global brand and with well-designed product propositions that we continue to enhance and strengthen with investment in our ship assets, people and technology. We also continue to benefit from our go-to-market strategy of focusing our marketing messages and consumer contact points on value rather than price and our marketing-to-fill versus discounting-to-fill strategy. We continue to support our sale, marketing and revenue management teams with state-of-the-art resources to help drive our industry leading net yields and which foster a corporate culture that encourages our team to work in tandem and across our brands to consistently fine tune our customer-centric offering to maximize our top and bottom line results. We continue to benefit from a customer sourcing strategy that, with the help of a value proposition that is now consistent around the globe, allows us to source the best guests; in other words, the most profitable guests from anywhere in the world and across our three brands. We continue to benefit from what I believe is a collection of the most skilled, most experienced, most dedicated and most agile management team, crew and staff in the industry who have demonstrated their character by overcoming challenges and delivering bottom line results time and time again that punch way above our weight with incredible grace, passion and effectiveness. We are also benefiting from our position in the industry in terms of capacity growth. The overblown and nagging concern by some industry observers regarding industry capacity coming online over the next few years should have already been allayed. But to drive the point further, I'll refer you to Slide 4, where we had laid out at the mix of industry capacity additions for the next two years. In each year, the amount of relevant, competitive capacity, in other words, new capacity or cruise line with whom our brands directly compete, is significantly less than the total capacity entering the industry in any given year. Expedition vessels, as well as vessels deployed in China or country-specific brand make up a considerable amount of new capacity coming online, capacity with which our brands simply do not compete with head on as our product offering, guest sourcing strategy and our itinerary deployments are fundamentally different from theirs. We are also benefiting from a global consumer demand environment that has remained healthy and may be getting healthier even as we enter the second decade of economic expansion in the United States as indicated by the record demand for our cruise vacation. Looking at our fleet of operations in 2019, Europe, which has been one of the stars in the last couple of years, is continuing its run of impressive pricing growth with year-over-year pricing up mid-single digits after two consecutive years of double-digit pricing growth. This is even more impressive given that first, this growth comes despite our 14% increase in capacity to the region, part of which stems from the pre-deployments of Norwegian Pearl from Alaska as part of our strategic itinerary optimization plan. And second, the timing of the redeployment was such that the sales and revenue management teams overcame the challenges of a nine-month booking window versus the traditional 18 to 24 months for these European voyages. As for the Europe source consumer, perhaps the best way to describe their mettle is with an example. At the beginning of this year's second quarter, the Norwegian brand harmonized its go-to-market offering in the U.K. and in Continental Europe by replacing the Premium All Inclusive market strategy I'd introduced 15 months prior with the Free at Sea proposition that has proven popular in all other parts of the globe. Since this switch to Free at Sea, European source revenue for the brand has grown over 50% compared to the same four-month period last year. This impressive growth demonstrates once again that authentic value propositions do drive consumer behavior, and we have what I strongly believe are the top rated consumer facing value propositions at each of our brands. At this time, Alaska continues to be one of our best performing markets. Similar to Europe, she is performing extremely well despite our 30% increase in capacity, which included for the first the Norwegian brand's two newest and largest ships. The redeployment of Norwegian Joy to Alaska resulted in a profound improvement to her profitability especially in the top line, driven by more than doubling of her onboard revenue generation. We are extremely pleased to not only see her garnering the high pricing she rightfully deserves but also to see her deliver a customer experience that ranks her first in guest satisfaction for the Norwegian brand, driven by the high tech and industry-first innovations found onboard. Looking ahead to 2020, the picture only gets better as demand, load factor and pricing continue to outpace 2019 record levels. Our two upcoming newbuilds are being extremely well received. Norwegian Encore remains the best booked Caribbean-introduced ship in the Norwegian brand's history and by a very wide margin, I may add. At the same time, Seven Seas Splendor is helping to push record pricing per region in 2020 despite her arrival causing a 26% increase in brand capacity. Along with Regent, strong demand is also benefiting sister brand Oceania Cruises with both the Oceania and Regent brands reaching the 50% load factor threshold for coming year sailing faster than ever before and at higher prices. These are strong statistics and a bullish indicator that the 10-year-old U.S. economic expansion is alive and well, at least in our three brands. Now I'd like to remind everyone of a comment I made on last quarter's call, and that is that record booked positions do not extend indefinitely, nor would we want them to. Our main goal is not to extend the booking curve to see as far as it will go, but instead to stay on our highly efficient and predictive booking curve to guide our ability to maximize ticket price to be the highest in the industry and which helps us attract the best customer who consistently contributes the most to onboard revenue through each and every voyage's sales cycle. And we will continue to hone our revenue management capabilities with further investments in advanced analytics that will further drive optimal pricing for every voyage. While I have covered quite a bit regarding the quarter and our future outlook at a high level, I'd like to now turn the call over to Mark to go over our results and guidance in more detail. Mark, please. ","Thank you, Frank. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2019 and 2018 net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics on a constant-currency basis. My prepared remarks will also delineate the impact from certain headwinds, including the change in Cuba regulations and a technical issue on Norwegian Pearl early in the third quarter. I'm pleased to report yet another record quarter, one where the company generated the highest second-quarter revenue and earnings in its history. As you can see on Slide 5, adjusted EPS grew 7.4% over prior year to $1.30, primarily as a result of our revenue outperformance in the quarter, which was driven by exceptionally strong onboard revenue and strong well priced close-in bookings. If not for the $0.06 impact from the Cuba regulation change, adjusted EPS would have exceeded our prior guidance by $0.03 or a 12.4% growth over prior year. Turning to Slide 6. Net yield increased 5.8% or 5% on an as-reported basis versus prior year, outperforming guidance expectations despite 50 basis points of headwind from canceled Cuba sailings. This growth includes 100 basis points of corporate net yield dilution from Norwegian Bliss while she primary sailed in the lower-yielding Mexican Riviera region, all of which was consistent with our expectations. If not for the Cuba impact, net yield would have increased 6.3% or an 80 basis points beat versus our guidance. This strong growth comes on top of prior year's solid net yield growth of 4%. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel, increased 6.1% versus prior year and 5.1% on an as-reported basis. Costs exceeded guidance for approximately 85 basis points, which was entirely due to certain onetime charges in connection with the Cuba regulation change. Excluding these, costs would have been slightly favorable versus guidance as a result of timing in the quarter. Total fuel expense was in line with expectations as fuel consumption savings offset an increase in our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges, which came in at $493. Turning to Q3, I'll direct you to Slide 7 to review deployment highlights. In the third quarter, our Europe mix is approximately 42%, an increase from prior year due to the addition of Norwegian Pearl. Alaska mix increased to approximately 21% as a result of the repositioning of Norwegian Joy while Caribbean is approximately 18%. Looking at expectations for the third quarter, core business fundamentals are strong despite headwinds in the quarter. In addition to the impact from Cuba, we experienced a technical issue on Norwegian Pearl in early July, which affected approximately one month of a premium priced peak summer sailing in the Mediterranean. This issue impacted earnings by approximately $0.07 per share, primarily in the top line. To demonstrate the strong underlying core performance of the business, I'll direct you to Slide 8, which contains our third-quarter guidance, together with the impact from the aforementioned headwinds in the quarter. Net yield is expected to increase approximately 1.75% or 1.5% on an as-reported basis and is net of an approximate 300-basis-point impact from both Cuba and the Pearl voyage disruption. This comes on top of strong prior-year growth of 4%, which included the benefit of premium priced Cuba sailings compared to the current year, which now includes lower priced Bahamas cruises that will have to be filled in a very condensed sales cycle. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel, is expected to be up approximately 8.25% or 7.75% on an as-reported basis. This is the highest growth quarter of the year, primarily due to incremental marketing expenses associated with Cuba and operating expenses associated with Pearl's voyage disruption, which combined are expected to account for approximately 300 basis points of the increase. In addition, we have the scheduled 18-day dry dock of Oceania's Regatta as part of OceaniaNEXT reinspiration program versus no dry dock days in the prior year. Looking at fuel expense. We anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $492 with expected consumption of approximately 195,000 metric tons. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EPS for the third quarter is expected to be approximately $2.15, which is inclusive of an expected $0.29 impact from both Cuba and Pearl. Exclusive of these headwinds, adjusted EPS guidance would have been $2.44 or a 7.5% increase over prior year, all on flat capacity growth. Turning to the full year, I'll walk you through the components of the revised adjusted EPS outlook on Slide 9. Top line outperformance in the second quarter, combined with a stronger revenue outlook for the back half of the year, resulted in an $0.08 benefit to the full year. Fuel, interest and other savings accounted for approximately $0.04, and these benefits were offset by a $0.45 impact from the Cuba change and a $0.07 impact from the Pearl technical issue. As a result, we now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5 to $5.10. If not for the $0.52 combined headwinds from both Cuba and Pearl, our guidance would have been in the range of $5.52 to $5.62 or a 13% increase over prior year and would have exceeded the high-end of our guidance range provided in May. Looking at expectations for other key operating metrics on Slide 10. Net yield for the year is expected to increase 2.6% or 2.1% on an as-reported basis despite an expected impact of 180 basis points from Cuba and Pearl. If not for those headwinds, net yield growth would have been 4.4% and implies an increase to the back half of the year of almost 50 basis points versus the prior implied guidance for the same period. Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel, is expected to be up approximately 4.5% or 4% on an as-reported basis. The 100-basis-point increase versus prior guidance is primarily due to the impacts from Cuba and Pearl. Looking at fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $487 with expected consumption of approximately 840,000 metric tons. Looking ahead to Q4, our implied net yield guidance is flat to prior year, which is inclusive of an approximately 330-basis-point Cuba impact. It is important to keep in mind that we are rolling over Norwegian Bliss' successful inaugural Caribbean season out of Miami in 2018. This year, she sailed a mix of Mexican Riviera and New York-based winter Caribbean sailings, while Norwegian Encore will take her place in Miami with a partial quarter of sailings. As such, the combined yield performance of Bliss and Encore resulted in an expected dilutive impact to our corporate net yield of approximately 125 basis points. Focusing on the fuel environment. We continue to strengthen our hedge program, and during the quarter, increased our overall portfolio and also entered into our first swaps for 2022. While there is still a small amount of uncertainty in connection with a new IMO regulations coming online in 2020, we continue to expect our 2020 total fuel expense net of hedges to be on the higher end of our typical range of 6% to 7% of gross revenue. This is consistent with our expectations and is driven by an increase in volume from capacity growth, as well as higher pricing. In addition, we continue to take advantage of the interest rate environment, and we recently executed a two-year $450 million costless collar to further minimize potential volatility in that line. This increases our fixed debt ratio from 75% to approximately 82%. Looking ahead to the broader outlook for 2020. While it is too early to provide guidance, we do want to provide an estimate on the flow-through of the Cuba regulation change to 2020 earnings. Based on our best estimates today, we believe the impact to be approximately $0.20 to $0.25, which primarily represents the loss of the premium pricing on the top line that our Cuba sailings garnered versus similar Bahamian or other itineraries. That said, despite the impact from regulation changes, we continue to be on a strong path toward achieving our full speed targets that we laid out at investor day in May of last year. Focusing on shareholder returns. We had previously communicative that we would take a balanced approach in returning to shareholders $1 billion to $1.5 billion of capital through year-end 2020 via share repurchases and/or potential initiation of quarterly dividends. Despite our continued outperformance, the earnings multiple for our company has contracted to record or near-record lows, which we believe reflects a significant disconnect between our share price and our long-term value and future growth profiles. Hopefully, Frank's earlier commentary regarding the strength and consistency of our business fundaments alleviates the concerns that are weighing our valuation. In the meantime, with our stock trading at a more than 50% discount to the S&P 500 average, we continue to use opportunistic share repurchases as the primary vehicle to return to shareholders. We continue to look forward to a time when our stock price reflects the strong fundamentals of our business. But given today's valuation, our board of directors believes that the most efficient way to return capital is through the opportunistic share repurchases while still maintaining focus on our desired leverage targets. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank to provide closing commentaries. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/08/08/norwegian-cruise-line-holdings-nclh-q2-2019-earnin.aspx
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) Q1 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"May. 09, 2019","Well, thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be here today to report on our first set of results for 2019. And as I'm sure you saw from this morning's earnings release, the results are very, very good. Performance in the first quarter exceeded what were already high expectations, with a top-line beat driven by strong pricing growth, robust close-in bookings and higher onboard spend. Combined, our first quarter beat with a strong wave season that saw new bookings come in at the highest pricing ever at each of our three brands, and the outcome is an increase to our full-year net yield growth guidance and an increase to our full-year earnings expectations. The midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share guidance now stands well above the high end of our previous guidance range, an outlook that would result in our seventh consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth, further extending our stellar track record of strong and consistent financial performance. In addition, during the quarter, we repurchased $200 million of our stock, bringing our total capital returns to shareholders under our Full Speed Ahead 2020 Targets to $600 million as we continue to make progress toward achieving the shareholder return, net leverage, adjusted return on invested capital and adjusted earnings-per-share growth targets under the plan. As discussed on our prior call, we entered 2019 in a record booked position and at higher prices. Our position of strength entering the year meant we were able to maintain our focus on driving prices, and drive we did, as wave season pricing came in at record levels. For the balance of 2019, we are booked in a similar load position to last year's record levels and at higher pricing on a comparable basis. Our load position is normalized with a significant difference in booking patterns of Norwegian Joy's charter sales model while deployed in China versus their traditional distribution and booking curve model in the west, along with certain changes in our 2019 itinerary mix, which includes a higher number of Caribbean and Bahamas cruises of less than seven days and which booked closer to sale date. Additionally and much more importantly, the quality and stickiness of our booked revenue has improved year over year, resulting from the full effect of our earlier final payment date policy, improved year-over-year booked deposit structure, and a significantly higher proportion of 2019 business that include our guests' air travel booked through Norwegian's Air program. Keep in mind that year-over-year record booked positions by definition cannot continue to expand indefinitely nor would we want them to. As someone who has been in this industry for over 25 years, there's always a nagging question that no matter how good your revenue management systems predict future demand or how effective your marketing campaigns push sales, perhaps some money was left on the table. And while that question can never be truly answered with absolute certainty, fortunately, in the case of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, if there is any money left on the table, it's on the margin, as evidenced by our strong first-quarter performance and increased net yield guidance for the balance of the year. Besides the momentum driven by the strength of our brands, our new hardware introductions and our unique go-to-market bundling strategy, also benefiting the strong booking environment are macroeconomic factors that continue to buoy consumer confidence. As we have stated over the last few quarters, we continue to see a strong macroeconomic environment, one which most economists and market watchers not believe will continue for some time, and that fears of a near-term recession or downturn have greatly diminished, particularly in the United States as evidenced by strong first-quarter GDP growth and recent Fed commentary. Fears of industry oversupply have also now subsided as the industry overall and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings in particular, have shown their ability to successfully absorb new capacity coming online. But all this would not be possible without a confident consumer willing to spend money on vacation travel. Consumers across the globe continue to have a strong appetite for cruise. This is especially true here in North America where we maintain an advantage, given our strong sourcing in the region and a focus on global versus national brand, and our exit from the lower-yielding China market. But that's not to say that we are narrowly focused on our home market. One of the advantages of operating a growing but still manageable 26-ship fleet is that we can focus on sourcing the best guests wherever they may reside. We have done this by making inroads into several sizable markets where growth is exceptionally strong, including Australia, Israel, Brazil and Mexico. Meanwhile, in more mature European markets like the U.K. and Germany, we have recently shifted the Norwegian brand's go-to-market offering. A year ago, we introduced Premium All Inclusive product in these markets, which has the desired effect of quickly and significantly raising prices to parity levels with those in North America. With the mission accomplished, we have now transitioned to the Free at Sea offering that has resonated so well in North America and in the rest of the world, and which now provides consistency of brand messaging around the globe. Results over the first five weeks of Free at Sea in the U.K. and Germany is an encouraging double-digit increase in booking volumes over the prior year, and even more over the first quarter of this year at comparable net pricing from those two important source markets despite the dampening influences of Brexit and other regional economic factors. And once our -- once onboard, our global consumers continue to exhibit their confidence in two ways: First, our onboard revenue performance to date has exceeded our expectation and has been outperforming last year's record levels. Part of the reason is the enhanced stickiness of onboard revenue from increases in pre-booking short excursion and other offerings, and the benefits in the Norwegian brand's Free at Sea go-to-market strategy. As an example, pre-booked onboard revenue is up solid double digits for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. With the second half of the year essentially organic and capacity growth only coming from Norwegian Encore, whose ticket yield will likely be lower than the corporate average due to our introduction into low season Caribbean itinerary, onboard revenue is expected to be a key contributor to net yield growth. Second, guests continue to book their next cruise before even finishing their current one in record numbers. Our strategy that captured guests will experience our award-winning vacation experiences has resulted in hefty record onboard cruise sales and the sale of future cruises tickets across our brands. The first quarter saw many highlights across our three brands. For the Norwegian brand, this quarter marked the first peak season of Caribbean sailings for our most successful newbuild to date, Norwegian Bliss. And just as she did in the last, last summer, her performance in the Caribbean this past quarter was nothing short of extraordinary. There is something about riding a go kart on a double-decker, 12-turn racetrack at 40 miles per hour under a beautiful blue Caribbean sky that makes guests want to sail on Bliss. The premium she is garnering compared to similar ships we deployed last year in the region and to other ships currently sailing similar voyages is impressive, powering the brand and the company to a very successful Caribbean season. In addition, the Norwegian brand was busy preparing Norwegian Joy for her debut in Alaska. As the vessel was virtually unknown in the North American marketplace as recently as nine months ago, the Norwegian sales and marketing teams worked diligently, and may I say, quickly, to increase awareness and introduce the vessel to travel partners and consumers in an abbreviated timeframe. As part of Joy's North America introduction, the team launched a successful giving Joy campaign to celebrate the intersection of travel and education, and to recognize the contributions of educators in the United States and in Canada with a chance to win cruise vacation. The campaign drew 46,000 nominations from over 1.4 million votes, with 30 winning educators being named from across North America. The team also took the opportunity to replicate the successful introduction of Norwegian Bliss with a slate of inaugural activities in the city -- in key cities of Los Angeles, Vancouver and Seattle, introducing the vessel to nearly 5,000 travel partners and loyal past guests. I had the opportunity to visit Norwegian Joy in her first sailing to Vancouver, and I can absolutely attest that she is even a more impressive ship today than the day she was delivered new, with upgraded public spaces and other revenue-generating venues that are geared to Norwegian's broad audience. Norwegian Joy houses many of the same innovative features that make her virtually identical to her sister ship, Norwegian Bliss, in putting a 20,000 square foot forward-facing observation lounge, perfect for indoor viewing of Alaska's world-famous vistas, and the exhilarating top-of-the-ship electric go-kart racetrack. She does, however, have several unique features that set her apart and likely makes her even better than Bliss, including 85 new concierge class staterooms that give the ship additional diversity and richness in cabin mix and offers guests an upgraded choice that sits above the traditional balcony stateroom, but does not quite reach the exclusivity and luxury of the ever-popular Haven suites. Joy also features the one-of-a-kind Galaxy Pavilion, a 100-person capacity gymnasium-sized space featuring immersive gameplay, racing simulators and a host of virtual and augmented reality experiences. The one-two punch of Norwegian Bliss and Norwegian Joy as the cornerstone of our deployment to high-yielding Alaska gives the Norwegian brand by far the largest, youngest and most innovative hardware in this premium destination, bar none. In terms of performance in the region, we are extremely pleased that pricing for Norwegian Joy's Alaska voyages are easily surpassing those of Norwegian Pearl, the 2,200-passenger ship she replaced. And keep in mind two things: first, Joy is not only garnering better pricing than her predecessor, but she also carries an additional 1,800 guests. Second, the onboard revenue opportunities on Norwegian Joy far eclipse those of her predecessor and is expected to drive meaningful improvement to the Norwegian brand's 2019 yield. Not to be outdone, Norwegian Bliss continues to garner historic yields in the region with certain lapping sailings continuing to price higher than her record-breaking inaugural season last year. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Alaska's deployment also leverages the investments we've made at the Port of Seattle in our development partnership with Icy Strait Point to deliver guests the best Alaska experience in the industry across our three brands. In addition, we are very proud to have been recently awarded a 10-year permit to sail Glacier Bay, Alaska cruising's most popular destination in both the peak and shoulder seasons through 2029. These permits are granted only once every decade by the U.S. National Park Service based on a very competitive and rigorous set of criteria. With Alaska now representing 9% of our annual capacity, and with its expected continued growth as a key deployment region, our strategic investments to develop new destinations and ability to maintain access to premium attractions sets the foundation for further growth in this high-yielding region. Meanwhile, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises continue their stellar booking performance, with both brands having little inventory to sell in 2019. The strong booking momentum is vividly on display as both brands are now approximately 40% sold for 2020, achieving this milestone record load factor earlier than ever before and at higher pricing. Oceania continues to roll out fleet and product enhancements under its OceaniaNEXT program. Insignia underwent their first enhancements under the program in a comprehensive dry-dock late last year, and the feedback from guests and travel partner has been extraordinary. And in keeping with this grand promise of offering the finest cuisine at sea, Oceania recently rolled out an expansive and diverse new selection of plant-based cuisine that reflects our guests' evolving pallets and heightened focus on wellness. These enhancements continue to strengthen the Oceania's brand, industry-leading position as having the finest cuisine at sea, a definitive competitive advantage. Our guest repeat rate of over 50% is as high as ever been. And just last month, the release of the brand's '20-2021 winter season deployment resulted in a single largest booking day in the brand's 16-year history. As for Regent, the construction of Seven Seas Splendor is well under way, and we are eagerly awaiting the January 2020 arrival of the ship that embodies luxury perfected. Splendor will not only make history as the newest standard for luxury cruising when she debuts, but she will also be the first ship in the cruise industry to launch with a female captain at the helm. Captain Serena Melani joined Regent in 2010 serving in several roles before becoming the brand's first female Master Captain in 2016. We are extremely proud to have Captain Melani leading the dedicated crew of Seven Seas Splendor during her inaugural season. And demonstrating the strength of the Regent brand's popularity among wealthy consumers, the growth in the total value of its bookings for 2020 sailings is significantly outpacing the brand's capacity increase of 26%, stemming from the addition of Splendor to the fleet and at higher prices. This is one of the reasons that advance ticket sales for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings were 18% higher at the end of the first quarter versus the end of the first-quarter 2018 despite a sub-3% increase in capacity for the company in 2019. This indeed has been a stellar quarter for the company, so I therefore would like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss our outperformance in the quarter and our improved guidance for the remainder of the year. Mark? ","Thank you, Frank. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2019 and 2018 net yield and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day metrics on a constant-currency basis. I'll begin with commentary on our first-quarter results, followed by color on booking trends, and close with our guidance for the second quarter and full-year 2019. Throughout my commentary, I will be referring to the slide presentation, which Andrea mentioned earlier in the call. I am pleased to report yet another record quarter, one where the company generated the highest first-quarter revenue and earnings in its history. Adjusted EPS grew 38% over prior year to $0.83 and exceeded our prior guidance by $0.13. As you can see on Slide 4, the beat was driven by $0.06 of revenue outperformance from exceptionally strong onboard revenue and strong well-priced close-in bookings; a $0.04 one-time incremental net tax benefit in connection with certain tax restructuring strategies, which was recorded as a $0.07 benefit below the line, partially offset by the other tax-related expenses of $0.03 in net cruise cost ex fuel. It should be noted that this net tax benefit is incremental to the $0.10 that was already included in our February earnings guidance. Lastly, a $0.03 benefit from foreign exchange and other below-the-line items, including a partial benefit from our share repurchase in the quarter. Turning to Slide 5. Net yield increased 4.1% or 3.2% on an as-reported basis versus prior year, outperforming guidance expectations by 160 basis points. The beat was driven by exceptionally strong onboard revenue across all major streams and better-than-expected pricing on close-in bookings. Excluding the benefit from new Norwegian brand capacity, Norwegian Bliss, which garnered yields above the corporate average in the quarter, first-quarter net yield growth would have been approximately 3.1%. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel increased 3.6% versus prior year and 3% on an as-reported basis. When comparing to guidance, costs were higher, primarily due to the previously mentioned tax-related expenses of $0.03. Total fuel expense was in line with expectations as fuel consumption savings offset an increase in fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, which came in at $461. Now let's discuss capacity and deployment for the second quarter. Our capacity is expected to increase approximately 2%, primarily due to the addition of Norwegian Bliss to the fleet. I will direct you to Slide 6 to review deployment highlights. In the second quarter, our Caribbean mix is approximately 26%, slightly higher than prior year due to Norwegian Bliss. Our deployment mix in Europe represents approximately 27%, a slight increase to prior year, due to the addition of Norwegian Pearl sailing out of Amsterdam. With the repositioning of Norwegian Joy to Alaska, mix in that region increases to approximately 13%, and conversely, the APAC's mix decreases to 3%. Our expectations for the second quarter can be found on Slide 7. Net yield is expected to increase approximately 5.5% or 5% on an as-reported basis, primarily driven by strong performance from our core fleet. The benefit from Norwegian Joy's redeployment to North America accounts for approximately 200 basis points of growth in the quarter. Excluding the benefit from our new Norwegian brand capacity, Norwegian Bliss, which is dilutive to the corporate average yield while sailing in the Mexican Riviera, net yield is expected to be approximately 6.5%. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately 5.25% or 4.5% on an as-reported basis, primarily due to direct costs from the dry-dock, repositioning and inaugural events of Norwegian Joy, as well as the approximately 50 days Joy was out of service, which results in fewer capacity days to allocate operating expenses over, thereby increasing our unit cost basis. Looking at fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $485 with expected consumption of approximately 207,000 metric tons. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EPS for the second quarter is expected to be approximately $1.33 or a 10% increase over prior year. Looking at expectations for the full year on Slide 8. Net yields for the year is expected to increase 3.5% to 4.5%, or 3% -- 3% to 4% on an as-reported basis, which represents a 50-basis-point increase at the midpoint versus our prior guidance issued in February. Excluding incremental capacity from Norwegian Bliss and Norwegian Encore results in only a marginal difference to our annual net yield guidance. As a reminder, Norwegian Bliss' Caribbean sailings in Q1 garnered yields above the corporate average and are expected to be offset by below corporate average yields when sailing in the Mexican Riviera. Concurrently, Encore's one month of revenue service does little to move the needle on a full-year basis. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately 3.5% or 3% on an as-reported basis. The 25-basis-point increase versus prior guidance is due to the previously mentioned tax-related expenses. Looking at fuel expense. We anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $490 with expected consumption of approximately 845,000 metric tons. We now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.40 to $5.50, which is above the high end of our previous range and would result in an 11% increase versus prior year at the midpoint. Excluding a $0.10 impact from unfavorable fuel prices and foreign exchange rates, our guidance would have been in the range of $5.50 to $5.60, or a 13% increase over prior year. On Slide 9, I'll walk you through the components of the $0.20 raise to our adjusted EPS outlook for the year. $0.14 of incremental net yield growth is made up of top-line outperformance in the first quarter of $0.06, combined with a stronger outlook for the remainder of the year of $0.08; a benefit from fuel consumption savings and other below-the-line items of $0.05; $0.07 of accretion from share repurchases executed in the quarter; the previously mentioned one-time incremental net tax benefit of $0.04, all of which are partially offset by headwinds from higher fuel prices and unfavorable foreign exchange rates of $0.10. Our updated outlook represents double-digit adjusted EPS growth over the prior year, which would continue our track record of delivering double-digit annual adjusted EPS growth to seven consecutive years. As a reminder, this guidance excludes one-time expenses of approximately $25 million for enhancements to Norwegian Joy associated with her redeployment to North America. Looking at fuel and the upcoming change in regulations. We continue to refine our fuel strategy to manage the changing landscape and minimize volatility. In Q1, we sold the remainder of our Brent hedge positions for a gain and replaced them with gas oil hedges, which we believe gives us better correlation to the fuel we consume. In addition, we entered into costless callers for approximately 14% of our remaining MGO consumption to further reduce volatility for the remainder of '19. The callers protect us from the risk of rising prices, while at the same time, allows us to benefit from potential price declines. Slide 10 provides a summary of our hedging program and our strategy in relation to the IMO 2020 regulations; a strategy that combines the utilization of closed loops, exhaust gas cleaning systems, and increased consumption of marine gas oil or other compliant fuel blends. We also minimize volatility around the interest rate environment with the addition of a three-year, $230 million interest rate swap, which increases our fixed debt ratio to approximately 75%. For the remainder of the year, there are a few housekeeping items to keep in mind around the cadence of growth in net yields and net cruise cost excluding fuel. Net yield growth for the third and fourth quarters are expected to be similar, and for net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day, we expect growth in the third quarter to be similar of that in the second quarter. Our progress toward achieving our Full Speed Ahead 2020 Targets continues on an upward trajectory. As you can see on Slide 11, in March, we repurchased $200 million in shares, which increased the cumulative amount of shareholder returns to $600 million in connection with our target of $1 billion to $1.5 billion by the end of 2020. As previously mentioned, our goal is to have a balanced approach to capital allocation strategy while maintaining maximum flexibility. Any further capital returns for the remainder of the year would likely be skewed to the latter part of the year, and we continue to explore with our board the possible initiation of a dividend. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank for closing commentary. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/05/10/norwegian-cruise-line-holdings-nclh-q1-2019-earnin.aspx
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NCLH) Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call Transcript,"Feb. 21, 2019","Thank you, Andrea, and good morning everyone. The team at Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings delivered what can only be described as a breakout year in 2018 with several key milestones and notable accomplishments achieved. The highlight of which is here on slide four of the accompanying presentation. I'd like to take just a few moments to recognize and thank the 33,000-plus team members across our organization and around the world for their remarkable contributions to our record results and for their dedication and passion in providing exceptional vacation experiences and world-class hospitality to the 2.8 million guests who sail the Seven Seas aboard at our 26 ships last year. We started 2018 in a record book position and while I don't want to get too far ahead of myself I am pleased to report that we started 2019 in a book position that is even better. I'll discuss more about 2019 later in my commentary. For 2018, stronger-than-anticipated demand and robust onboard spend across all three brands and across all source and destination markets along with the launch of the most successful newbuild in Norwegian's history propelled adjusted earnings per share and net yield growth well past what were already high expectations at the beginning of the year. Norwegian Bliss was indeed a major driver of this outperformance. When we launched during April, the expectation was for strong performance and pricing premiums on par with other newbuild introductions. But instead, we have experienced performance that can only be described as extraordinary with demand, ticket pricing and onboard revenue metrics that have all shattered records and surpassed our highest expectations. And if you worry that Bliss might only be a one-year wonder, please note that in months where 2019 lapped for 2018 debut where ticket yields are equal to what in some months slightly higher than a inaugural season. A follow-up performance seldom is ever seen in our industry. In 2018 we achieved record highs in several key financial metrics including revenue which surpassed $6 billion and GAAP net income which was just shy of reaching the $1 billion milestone along with adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margins and most notably a net ticket and net onboard revenue yield where we continued to lead the industry by an extraordinarily wide margin. As you can see on slides five and six, we not only led the industry in net ticket net onboard and total net yield in 2018 but also in revenue growth which hit 12. 2% on capacity growth of just 8.5% and adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 24% and an EBITDA per capacity day. These highs helped extend our hard-fought and lengthy track record of strong financial performance. This past year marked our fifth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth, our sixth consecutive year of net yield growth, and as shown on slide seven, over a decade of year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA with continued margin expansion. We also made meaningful progress toward achieving our Full Speed Ahead 2020 Targets, which we set out at our Investor Day last May. With two years left in our three-year plan, we are more confident than ever in achieving our stated targets. In terms of financial performance, 2018 will certainly be remembered as a breakout year, but there were other significant events that also made this year so memorable. On the ownership front we reached an important milestone with the exit of our main sponsors including Apollo Global Management which exited its 11-year stake in Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings concluding what was undoubtedly one of the firm's most profitable pre-financial crisis vintage investments. And as I previously mentioned, we took delivery of Norwegian Bliss, the most successful ship in the Norwegian brand's 52-year history. We continue to see strong demand for her sailings in the Caribbean and as previously noted especially for her second Alaska season this coming summer. We also launched OceaniaNEXT, a multifaceted program including a complete reinspiration of the brand's four classic vessels along with more ambitious initiatives which I will touch upon later. These achievements and milestones taken together have strengthened the financial and operational foundation of the long-term strategy we have laid out and positions us well as we move into 2019 and beyond. And just as we did in 2018, we entered the year in record book position and at record pricing which has allowed us to capitalize on 2019 strong WAVE season during which we have witnessed the highest pricing of sold inventory in the history of the company. This achievement puts us in a strong position from which to continue driving meaningful price appreciation on remaining inventory and to optimize the positioning and launch of our next newbuild Norwegian Encore which joins the fleet in late November. And while it is still early in the overall booking cycle, the strong demand we are experiencing across all brands and across all markets is also spilling over into 2020 with the Company's three brands now substantially better booked and at higher prices than at this time last year for 2019. This robust performance has resulted in the booking curve extending approximately 9% over last year with our advanced ticket sales balance at year-end 2018 spanning an impressive 22% higher than at year-end 2017. The underlying strength of this booking curve is best observed in our Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands where each line is now better than 80% booked for 2019 sailings and nearly one-third booked for 2020 sailings, all at meaningfully higher prices to the previous years. From our vantage point, there does not seem to be a near-term end to the bull booking conditions our Company has and is experiencing. Our yield guidance for 2019 which Mark will cover in his commentary gives everyone confidence about the state of the vacationing consumer and therefore of our Company's prospects, particularly those who are still concerned about where we are in the economic cycle and those concerned with the higher-than-average industry capacity growth. Our Norwegian brand for example when Essence launched three 4,000 passenger vessels Norwegian Bliss, Joy and Encore in a span of just 18 months, representing a 24% increase in the brand capacity making it by far the largest capacity increase in any 18-month period in our history. Bliss' stellar performance to date is well documented and Norwegian Encore continues to be the best booked and highest-priced Caribbean introduced ship in the Norwegian brand's history. But to also be able to absorb Norwegian Joy's deployment to Alaska in the Mexican Riviera and to do so with a sales window that is only nine months or half as long as that of a typical ship introduction while still delivering strong pricing should completely dispel any overcapacity fears at least as they pertain to Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. This successful absorption of capacity demonstrates three things. First, that our go-to-market strategy and retail value proposition, smart and disciplined marketing spend and sophisticated revenue management practices which we purposely do not publicly discuss very much for competitive reasons, indeed drive quality demand and generate industry-leading financial results. Second, that 2019 marks the first in a four-year stretch of moderate capacity growth as a company with a CAGR of less than 4% which bodes very well for our ability to profitably absorb future capacity increases while continuing to drive pricing higher. And third, there remains many attractive unserved and underserved markets both domestically and globally where our brands can deploy future capacity additions. Meanwhile, the Oceania and Regent brands as I mentioned earlier are enjoying record book positions and strong pricing power of their own. So well booked are these brands for 2019 that they are now pivoting their marketing initiatives earlier in the year than ever before to build an even stronger base for 2020 sailings which includes the introduction of the Regent Seven Seas Splendor and a full year of sailings by three of the four Oceania R-Class ships that will have received extensive refurbishment under the OceaniaNEXT program. Turning to consumers, and despite stock market volatility, fear of trade wars, Brexit uncertainty and other short-term disruptions such as the recent government shutdown, our indications are that consumers remain confident in both the short and long term especially the all-important North American consumer from which we enjoy an outsized benefit given our strategic sourcing mix and focus on global versus national brands. We are also benefiting on several other fronts. First, our go-to-market strategy and the sizable marketing investments we have made to communicate the wonders of our three brands to travel agents and consumers as guests are recognizing more and more the benefits of booking early to get the best and highest value. Our elongated booking window is proof of this. And another data point is the sale of future cruises onboard our ships. In 2018, all three of our brands experienced meaningful increases in the number of guests who booked their next cruise even before finishing their current one, locking them in into future cruises while reducing marketing-related costs. Second, we are benefiting from the continued shift of consumer spend from material things to experiences. While the retail sector has been a mixed bag of data, the experience economy as we see it remains strong. And third, just as we are seeing consumer confidence in booking cruises further out, we are seeing equal confidence in their current spending as the onboard revenue continues to surpass the record levels of the prior year. Lastly, we continue to leverage the strong global demand environment with our expanded worldwide sales and marketing organization that allows us to further hone our best guest strategy which focuses on sourcing the best guest defined as the highest yielding guests regardless of their providence. At the same time, our core markets remain strong. 2018 was the second consecutive year of double-digit pricing growth in Europe driven by all three brands while 2019 is building on that solid foundation with pricing above last year's record levels. In Alaska, despite industry capacity growth in the mid-teens which includes our very own 27% increase in capacity, we expect another blockbuster season with Norwegian Joy joining Norwegian Bliss and Norwegian Jewel. Norwegian Joy's repositioning to Alaska has brought heightened attention to this market and to the Norwegian brand. Joy is booking well and at higher prices compared to the smaller vessels she replaced in our deployment despite her condensed nine-month booking window. And lastly, business in the Caribbean continues to accelerate and we are pleased with our performance in the region as we await the late year introduction of Norwegian Encore. So the story for 2019 Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings is taking shape. A strong start to the year with a record booked position the successful absorption of a record capacity increase in the most profitable North American market, a confident consumer that is willing to book further and further out and is going to spend more and more on board. It all sounds to me like the making of an encore performance. I'll return at the end of the call to discuss our longer-term initiatives, but now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss our results and guidance in more detail. Mark? ","Thank you, Frank. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2018 and 2017 net yield and adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day metrics on a constant currency basis. I'll begin with commentary on our fourth quarter and full year results followed by color on booking trends and close with our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2019. Throughout my commentary, I will be referring to the slide presentation which Andrea mentioned earlier in the call. I am pleased to report yet another record quarter one where the Company generated the highest fourth quarter revenue and earnings in its history. Adjusted EPS of $0.85 exceeded expectations by $0.07. As you can see on slide eight, the beat was driven by $0.02 of revenue outperformance from strong well-priced close-in bookings and exceptionally strong onboard revenue; a $0.04 benefit below the line from the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on our advanced ticket sales obligation which we expect to reverse in 2019 and will impact our reported revenue and yield metrics. And a $0.04 benefit from interest tax and other below the line items, all of which were partially offset by higher ship operating expenses as well as performance-related compensation expense. Turning to slide nine. Net yield increased 4.7% or 4.2% on an as-reported basis versus prior year, outperforming guidance by 70 basis points. The beat was driven by strong well-priced close-in bookings and exceptionally strong onboard revenue across all major revenue streams. Excluding the benefit from new Norwegian brand capacity, Norwegian Bliss which garnered yields above the NCLH corporate average in the quarter, our fourth quarter net yield growth would have been approximately 4.5% which excludes approximately 75 basis points of revenue dilution from China operations related to the itinerary optimization initiative. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel increased 3.6% versus prior year and 3.4% on an as-reported basis. Our total fuel expense was in line versus expectations as fuel consumption savings offset an increase in fuel price per metric ton net of hedges which came in at $496. Turning to full year results. 2018 finished strong and we delivered yet another record year of financial performance. Both revenue and earnings were the highest in our history and we achieved a record adjusted EBITDA margin of 31.3% up from 30.7% in the prior year and expanded our double-digit adjusted ROIC to 11%. Turning to slide 10. Full year adjusted earnings per share grew 24% to $4.92 or $0.37 above the midpoint of our initial full year guidance issued last February. This result comes despite a $0.07 impact from unfavorable fuel prices. Outperformance in the top line from continued strong demand for our portfolio of products and Norwegian Bliss's record-breaking inaugural season contributed to the beat to guidance. Revenue grew over 12% versus prior year reaching a record $6.1 billion. Other key financial metrics for the full year 2018 include, net yield growth of 3.5% or 3.7% on an as-reported basis which exceeded the midpoint of our prior guidance by 20 basis points. The year benefited from the successful introduction of Norwegian Bliss, strong demand for European sailings, additional high-yielding sailings to Cuba, well-priced close-in demand and stronger-than-expected onboard revenue. Excluding new Norwegian brand capacity, full year net yield growth would have been approximately 3.8% which excludes approximately 30 basis points of revenue dilution from China operations. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel increased 2.6% or 2.9% on an as-reported basis. And fuel price per metric ton net of hedges increased to $483 from $465 in the prior year. It's important to note that while fuel pricing decreased since our last call, our substantial hedge position entering Q4 as well as the lag in the at-the-pump pricing minimized any tailwind from the market declines. Shifting to 2019. On a full year basis, our capacity is expected to nominally increase approximately 2.7%. With the annualization of Norwegian Bliss along with the late November introduction of Encore to the fleet partially offset by the approximately 50-day drydock and repositioning for Norwegian Joy. As Frank mentioned earlier, 2019 is the first year in a four-year stretch of moderate capacity growth for our Company. I'll direct you to slide 11 to review some deployment highlights. For the year, a little over one-third of our capacity is in the Caribbean which includes Norwegian Bliss and Encore's debut in the region while capacity in Europe is up in the low teens as we deploy a sixth Norwegian ship to that region in the peak summer. Norwegian Joy's redeployment results in a decrease in APAC share of our deployment and increases Alaska's share which equates to approximately 27% capacity increase in the region. First quarter deployment is similar to prior year with the exception of APAC who share decreases as Norwegian Joy enters drydock before her repositioning to Alaska. Looking at expectations for the full year on slide 12. Strong booking trends have continued across all core markets and all three brands. Adjusted EPS for full year 2019 is expected to be in the range of $5.20 to $5.30 or approximately 7% growth over prior year at the midpoint. This includes an adjustment for the onetime noncash write-off in depreciation and amortization of approximately $25 million associated with Norwegian Joy's enhancements, which will make her even better than her record-breaking sister ship Norwegian Bliss. Since our last earnings call, we have seen a decrease in both fuel prices and interest rates which has been partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates resulting in a net tailwind of approximately $0.10 per share. As previously discussed, our expectations for 2019 earnings growth in the high single-digit range is primarily a result of four factors. First, we have moderate in-year capacity growth of approximately 2.7%. Second, we are lapping extremely strong financial performance in 2018 with adjusted earnings growth of 24%. Third, we are incurring marketing and launch costs associated with two upcoming ship launches, Norwegian Encore in late 2019 and Seven Seas Splendor in early 2020 with minimal in-year contribution due to the timing of deliveries. And lastly, the itinerary optimization initiatives skews both our yield and cost metrics higher in 2019 due to a partial year benefit from higher revenues which will be substantially offset by the associated costs, including the extended drydock and repositioning for Joy. Net yields for the year is expected to increase 3% to 4% or 2.5% to 3.5% on an as-reported basis. This performance is on top of the already robust 3.8% growth we delivered in 2018 which excludes approximately 30 basis points of revenue dilution from China operations. When excluding incremental capacity from Norwegian Bliss and Norwegian Encore, it results in only a marginal difference to our annual net yield guidance of 3% to 4%. Norwegian Bliss's Caribbean sailings are garnering yields above the NCLH corporate average and are offset by the low corporate average yields when sailing in the Mexican Riviera. Concurrently, Encore's one month of revenue service does little to move the needle. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately 3.25% or 2.75% on an as-reported basis. This is primarily due to an increase in total drydock days and associated costs versus prior year, fewer capacity days which increase our systemwide unit cost due to the approximate 50 days Norwegian Joy will be out of service to complete her drydock, reposition to Seattle and carry out inaugural activities. Incremental marketing costs associated with the deployments of the vessels involved in the itinerary optimization initiative and marketing and inaugural expense for Norwegian Joy, Encore and Seven Seas Splendor. Looking at fuel expense. We anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $465 with expected consumption of approximately 860,000 metric tons. We have continued to strategically layer on additional MGO hedges for 2019 and 2020 and are now hedging into 2021. As a result, we currently have 57%, 53%, and 33% of our total fuel consumption hedged for 2019, 2020 and 2021. There are a few key items to keep in mind for the balance of 2019. When looking at the cadence of net yield growth, the first quarter is expected to be the lowest yield growth quarter primarily as a result of the Easter holiday shift into the second quarter as well as Norwegian Joy's final China sailings during the low-priced winter season. We expect net yield growth for the remaining three quarters to be relatively consistent as Norwegian Joy's redeployment to North America will offset the tougher comps from the lapping of Norwegian Bliss's inaugural season as well as the impact from six scheduled drydocks for the high-yielding Oceania and Regent brands. As for the cadence of the net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day, the third quarter is expected to be the highest growth quarter mainly due to the timing of drydocks with one scheduled drydock for an Oceania vessel occurring at the tail end of the quarter compared to zero dry docks in the prior year. Q2 is expected to be the second highest quarter primarily due to the drydock and repositioning of Norwegian Joy. Now let's take a look at our expectations for the first quarter which can be found on slide 13. Net yield is expected to increase approximately 2.5% or 2% on an as-reported basis. This growth comes despite headwinds from the shift of the Easter holiday into the second quarter which includes premium price sailings for the spring break period as well as Norwegian Joy's final China sailings. Excluding the benefit from our new Norwegian brand capacity, Norwegian Bliss, which is garnering yields above the NCLH corporate average while sailing in the Caribbean, net yield growth is expected to be approximately 2%. This comes on top of 4% growth in the prior year. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately 2.5% or 2% on an as-reported basis. As for fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $456 with expected consumption of approximately 215,000 metric tons. Looking below the line, we expect a $0.10 onetime benefit from tax planning initiatives as discussed on our previous call which has shifted from Q4 to Q1 and is expected to be partially offset by $0.04 exchange loss resulting in a net benefit of approximately $0.06. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EPS for the first quarter is expected to be approximately $0.70, a 17% increase over the prior year. As Frank mentioned earlier, in 2018 we made significant progress toward achieving our Full Speed Ahead 2020 Targets, that we provided at our Investor Day. As you can see on slide 14, we've reported better-than-expected adjusted EPS growth of 24%, increased our double-digit adjusted ROIC to 11%, delevered our balance sheet to 3.3 times and returned $400 million or approximately one-third of our targeted $1 billion to $1.5 billion of capital to shareholders all in just (Technical Difficulty). Looking at Slide 15. Our cash generation continues to accelerate and we remain extremely focused on returning meaningful capital to our shareholders. In 2018, we repurchased a total of approximately $665 million worth of shares under our previous and current repurchase authorizations. We have a $600 million remaining on our current $1 billion three-year authorization. Our goal is to have a balanced approach to our capital allocation strategy while maintaining maximum flexibility. We continue to explore with our Board, the potential initiation of a dividend. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank for closing commentary.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NCLH) Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call Transcript,"Nov. 08, 2018","Thank you, Andrea; and good morning, everyone. The third quarter of 2018 picked up with the second quarter left-off, as a robust demand environment, coupled with precision, execution by our three brands led to record revenue and earnings; and perhaps more importantly, contributed to an acceleration of our 2019 record book position. It was a quarter where continued strong demand, stimulated by cost effective marketing initiatives and other demand creation strategies and led by a confident US consumer, combined with the multiple benefits of a mostly refurbished fleet and the introduction of the Norwegian Bliss, the most successful newbuild in our Company's history all confluence to generate the highest revenue and earnings of any quarter in our history. To put this milestone into proper perspective, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter just ended, equaled adjusted earnings per share for all of 2014, the year of the transaction that brought Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises into the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings family. I'm sure everyone will agree that the revenue and earnings growth of our Company over the last several years has been truly outstanding. Our third quarter results were buoyed by three main drivers. First, the blockbuster inaugural season of Norwegian Bliss. Second, strong demand across our three brands, primarily from North American for voyages and premium destinations, particularly Europe. And third, outstanding performance from our two upscale brands. Regarding Norwegian Bliss, and to put it bluntly, the vessel is the gift that keeps on giving. The images of guests speeding on her double decker go-kart race track with the Seattle skyline or Alaska's majestic glaciers in the background, have become calling cards for the brand, appearing in countless Instagram feeds worldwide and generating consumer interest in the Norwegian brand that no amount of money can buy. Bliss's outstanding financial performance, especially in onboard revenue has exceeded even our highest expectations, while on the ticket front, she has spearheaded the effort that drove a 25%-plus pricing increase on the Norwegian brand's three-ship Alaska deployment, despite a 15% capacity increase. As for the strong demand environment, it was led by a banner year for travel from the new to the old world. We were pleasantly surprised by the further acceleration of demand from North Americans wanting to cruise on Europe itineraries across our three brands. At the same time, the Norwegian brand's innovative premium all-inclusive product allowed to attract a higher caliber European consumer and at higher prices. The result is a second consecutive year of double-digit pricing growth for the all-important Europe season. The performance of our two upscale brands: Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises is equally impressive. On our last call, you'll recall we mentioned that the two brands that are already broached the 50% load factor mark for 2019. And while that strong booking trend continues to fill next few sailings at an unprecedented pace, it also led to record revenue and yield for the two brands in the third quarter, along with a record number of past guests traveling onboard the 10-ship fleet, the best and most accurate barometer of the strong brand affinity and high customer satisfaction levels that Oceania and Regent enjoy. Our confidence in our full-year outlook is such that we have again raised our earnings guidance above the top end of our previous guidance range with adjusted earnings per share now expected to be approximately $4.85, reflecting a 22.5% growth over the prior year. We also see this robust demand environment continuing into 2019, with the booking window continues to hover at the historic elongated levels we have seen during the past two years. So strong is this environment that we have once again expect to enter the New Year in a record book position with approximately 65% occupancy on the book as we turn the calendar to 2019 and at higher prices. As I mentioned on our last call, Oceania and Regent were better booked at that point in time for the coming year than at any other time in their history and we are pleased to report that booking volumes and pricing levels have accelerated over the past 13 weeks, leading their book position to improve even further to new higher highs. The Norwegian brand too has seen booking volumes accelerate over the past 13 weeks and its year-over-year lead in occupancy has also been extended. Overall, our 2019 book position remains well ahead of this year's record levels in occupancy and pricing across all three brands with advance ticket sales up 24% year-over-year on an 8% increase in capacity. 2019 will also see the introduction of Norwegian Encore, the final ship in the Breakaway Plus Class. She has all of the innovative features of her wildly successful sister ship Norwegian Bliss, with a few new features yet to be announced. Her hull art was created by award-winning Catalan artist Eduardo Arranz-Bravo and is a kaleidoscope of colors that will make her instantly recognizable as she sails her inaugural season to the Caribbean from Miami in the winter season, and to Bermuda from New York City in the summer. Norwegian Encore will begin her inaugural season sailing Caribbean itineraries from Miami toward the end of 2019 where she joins a Caribbean deployment, which continues to strengthen and is up on both occupancy and pricing for the year. Encore, it should be noted at this juncture, is the best booked ship both in load and price introduced in the Caribbean since we launched our first Breakaway Class ship in the region back in 2013. Also in 2019, we are excited to build upon this success and positive reaction from travel agents and guests alike regarding the Norwegian Edge and Regent Seven Seas refurbishment programs by launching a reinspiration program for Oceania Cruises dubbed OceaniaNEXT. These fleet revitalization programs are central to our core go-to-market strategy of operating the best possible hardware coupled with offering consumers a cruise vacation with the best value proposition, allowing us to source the highest quality guests to our brands, which in turn drive the highest yields. The first initiative of the Oceania program is the $100 million enhancement to our four R-Class vessels, which will include complete refurbishment of each and every state room and a reimagination of all public areas from dining rooms to bars and lounges. And while the OceaniaNEXT program results in an increased number of dry-dock days to the brand in 2019 over 2018, the work and investment will pay off handsomely beginning in 2020 as a freshly refurbished fleet in since passed and new guests alike to sail on a better-than-new ship further stimulating overall demand and commanding higher prices. One additional initiative for driving demand that we are very excited about is the evolution and extension of our go-to-market bundling strategy. The Norwegian Cruise Line brand's Free at Sea offering has been an incredible success with both consumers and travel agents and is the primary driver behind why NCLH boasts the highest ticket and highest onboard revenue yield of the three public cruise companies and by a wide margin. So I challenge the Norwegian team to add even more value to our bundle offerings and to provide an even more inclusive and compelling value proposition to consumers. The result is the Norwegian brand's recently launched free air, which seamlessly bundles airfare with and complements the Free at Sea offerings of free open bar, free specialty dining, free shore excursions, free Wi-Fi and fail-safe (ph) free in one inclusive cruise fare. The advantages of this next evolution of our unique bundling strategy are many. First, it overcomes a major hurdle of what high yielding long haul customers need and want, easy-to-book and affordable air transportation. The success of Free at Sea has demonstrated that there is a overwhelming demand for an inclusive contemporary cruise product. Free air is the natural extension of that strategy. Secondly, travel agents are further incented to market and sell the Norwegian brand's products over those of competitors, given the opportunity to earn additional commission on air-inclusive packages. And third, the offering strategically focuses on capturing more long haul flight cruise guests reinforcing our strategy of sourcing the highest quality guest as long haul guests tend to be higher paying consumers, both in ticket purchase and in onboard spend versus short-haul drive cruise customers. Last and certainly not least, the more inclusive offering the more it enable us to drive higher pricing and better margins, which we are clearly seeing in our results. We recently tested this strategy in the newly launched post-China itineraries for voyages on Norwegian Joy, whose booking window is approximately 9 months or 50% shorter than usual due to the timing of her deployment announcement from China to Alaska. The program has proved a great success and we have since selectively rolled out free air across additional itineraries where air transportation is a major purchase consideration. With the program success, we will look to provide even more avenues for guests to take advantage of this special value-add offering in the near future. I will go into more details on what is on the horizon for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings in 2019 a little later, but now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark to review results for the quarter and provide guidance for the rest of the year. Mark? ","Thank you, Frank. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary compares 2018 and 2017 net yields and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day metrics on a constant currency basis. I'll begin with commentary on our third quarter results, followed by color on booking trends and will then discuss our guidance for fourth quarter and full year 2018, and close with a few items to consider as we look into 2019. Throughout my commentary, I will be referring to the slide presentation which Andrea mentioned earlier in the call. I am pleased to report yet another record quarter, one where the Company generated the highest quarterly revenue and earnings in its history. Slide four summarizes how our adjusted earnings per share of $2.27 exceeded expectations by $0.07, primarily driven by $0.02 of revenue outperformance from strong, well-priced, close-in bookings and exceptionally strong onboard revenue. A $0.02 benefit in fuel expense driven by better-than-expected fuel consumption efficiency from our newbuilds and benefits from continued energy savings initiatives, which were partially offset by higher fuel prices. And a $0.02 benefit resulting from the timing of certain ship operating costs, which have shifted into the fourth quarter, and the remainder comes from other below-the-line items. Turning to slide five. Net yield increased 4% or 3.9% on an as-reported basis versus prior year, outperforming guidance expectations by 50 basis points. The beat was driven by strong, well-priced close-in bookings and exceptionally strong onboard revenue across all major revenue streams. Excluding the benefit from our new Norwegian brand capacity, Norwegian Bliss, which garnered yields above the NCLH corporate average in the quarter, our third quarter net yield growth would have been approximately 2.25%, which excludes approximately 50 basis points of revenue dilution from China operations related to the itinerary optimization. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel, increased 2% versus prior year and 2.1% on an as-reported basis, slightly favorable to our guidance due to the timing of certain costs. Our total fuel expense was favorable versus expectations, as fuel consumption savings more than offset an increase in fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, which came in at $510. Now let's discuss capacity and deployment for the fourth quarter. Capacity is expected to increase approximately 7.7%, primarily due to the introduction of Norwegian Bliss into the fleet. Approximately 46% of our capacity is deployed in the Caribbean, in line with the prior year. Highlights for the region in the quarter include Norwegian Bliss, which is sailing her first winter season for Miami. Additionally, Norwegian Breakaway will homeport for the first time from New Orleans operating a Western Caribbean itinerary. She will be Norwegian's largest and newest ship to sail from the Belize (ph). And we are excited to bring this innovative Breakaway Class ship to this new homeport. Europe represents approximately 13% of our deployment, down slightly from prior year. As for other key markets, Asia, Africa Pacific accounts for approximately 13%, Hawaii 4% with the remaining balance of our deployment comprised of repositioning cruises, South America sailings, as well as Panama Canal and Mexican Riviera voyages. Our expectations for the fourth quarter can be found on slide six. Net yield is expected to increase approximately 4% or 3.7% on an as-reported basis. This growth comes despite headwinds from the higher-than-expected revenue impact from China sailings related to the itinerary optimizations discussed on our last call. Excluding the benefit from our new Norwegian brand capacity, Norwegian Bliss, which is garnering yields above the NCLH corporate average, while sailing in the Caribbean, net yield growth is expected to be approximately 4.25%, which excludes approximately 75 basis points of revenue dilution from China operations. Turning to costs. Adjusted net net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be up approximately 1.5% or 1.75% on an as-reported basis, primarily due to additional marketing investments to support the new itineraries launch as part of the aforementioned itinerary optimization and to drive 2019 and 2020 bookings, all of which will be funded by a one-time benefit as a result of certain tax planning initiatives. An increase in the accrual of performance-related compensation due to higher confidence that certain annual performance targets will be achieved at year-end and the timing of certain expenses between the third and fourth quarters. Looking at fuel expense, we anticipate our fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, to be $484, with expected consumption of approximately 215,000 metric tons. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $0.78, a 15% increase over prior year. Slide seven outlines our latest guidance for the full year. Adjusted net yield is expected to increase approximately 3.3% or 3.6% on an as-reported basis, which represents a 130 basis point increase versus our initial 2018 guidance provided in February. Excluding new tonnage introduced for the Norwegian brand, net yield is expected to be up 3.8%, which excludes approximately 30 basis points of revenue dilution from China operations. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel, is expected to be up 2% or 2.5% on an as-reported basis. The increase versus prior guidance is attributed to the aforementioned sales and marketing investments, and increased performance incentive compensation. Looking at fuel expense. Our fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, is expected to be $480 with expected consumption of approximately 817,000 metric tons. Fuel consumption favorability is being offset by higher fuel prices for the remainder of the year. As a result of these revised expectations, our improved adjusted EPS outlook of approximately $4.85 once again surpasses the high-end of our previous guidance range and represents a 22.5% growth, which comes on top of the prior year's strong growth of 16%. Slide eight walks through the components of the $0.10 raise in our adjusted EPS guidance. $0.04 is attributable to the revenue outperformance, half of which comes from the third quarter and the other half from operational performance in the fourth quarter, partially offset by approximately $0.02 from incremental revenue dilution from China operations; a $0.04 benefit from lower depreciation and amortization; a $0.05 benefit as a result of tax planning initiatives, which is fully offsetting the $0.05 increase in certain net cruise costs; and the remaining benefit is due to a slight improvement for our outlook in interest expense and other below-the-line items. Our margins continue to expand in 2018, with further expansion expected in 2019 and beyond, as we leverage our growth profile to drive topline results, while our razor-sharp focus on controllable costs is complemented by the scale benefit we will enjoy from the launch of new ships into our fleet. As for the balance sheet, it continues to strengthen and we expect to be approximately 3.3 times levered at the end of 2018. And are on track to reach our targeted leverage range of 2.5 to 2.75 times by the end of 2020. In addition, we are also on track to deliver on our 2020 adjusted EPS CAGR, adjusted ROIC and shareholder return targets we provided at Investor Day, which are illustrated on slide nine. This comes despite headwinds from rising fuel prices and fluctuating foreign exchange rates. Now I'd like to provide some context on 2019 expectations. The year is shaping up extremely well as the robust booking environment for cruise vacations remains healthy, bolstered by our successful demand generation initiatives, resulting in strong demand across our three brands. And while we expect 2019 earnings growth in the single-digit range for a multitude of reasons, the core fundamentals of our business are strong and fully intact. Next year's earnings growth is a reflection of the timing of our newbuild deliveries, coupled with our investment in the strategic itinerary optimization initiative, which are both expected to benefit future period results and bolster shareholder returns in 2020 and beyond. And let's not forget, 2019 is lapping extraordinary financial results with 2018 earnings growth of 22.5%. Now, let's walk through a few items to keep in mind as we move into next year. First, as previously discussed, our strategic itinerary optimization initiative is expected to drive strong organic net yield growth, primarily as a result of Norwegian Joy's redeployment. However, at the same time, one-time cost related to the initiative, including a non-cash write-off of approximately $25 million are expected to mostly offset the incremental revenue and related contribution generated in 2019. Both our net yield and our net cruise cost metrics will increase, resulting in only a slight accretion to adjusted earnings per share for the year. In 2020 and beyond, we expect to realize the full earnings power from the strategic initiative with accretion to adjusted EPS expected to be approximately $0.30. Second, the first quarter is expected to be the lowest yield growth quarter as a result of the shift of the Easter holiday into the second quarter of 2019, as well as Joy's final China sailings during the low season. Third, our incremental marketing costs associated with the new deployments of the vessels involved in the optimization initiative, as well as launch and inaugural expenses for Norwegian Encore and Seven Seas Splendor as they do not enter the fleet until November 2019 and January 2020, respectively. Concurrently, higher fuel pricing is expected to drive fuel cost, net of hedges, approximately 10% higher versus 2018 expectations. Lastly, there are nine scheduled dry-docks for the year, including six of the 10 ships and the combined high-yielding Oceania and Regent fleet. Turning back to the fuel environment. As the 2020 IMO regulations approach, we strategically layered on additional MGO hedges for both 2019 and 2020 to mitigate our exposure to the markets. As a result, we currently have 55% and 49% of our total fuel consumption hedge in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Also, in an effort to improve the future correlation between our hedge proxy and the price we pay at the pump, we switched our proxy for hedging MGO from Brent to Gasoil. As a refined distillate product similar to MGO, Gasoil is expected to better protect against the risk of increased pricing spreads as opposed to Brent. As we look beyond 2020, we expect to equip our two Breakaway Class ships with exhaust gas cleaning systems, which will further insulate us from higher fuel prices starting in 2021. As a reminder, all of our installations are closed-loop systems, which is a higher standard than that of current regulations. To recap, as you can see on slide 10, we've delivered another record quarter with the highest revenue and earnings in our Company's history. We have once again increased our full-year outlook above the high end of previous guidance. We have strong conviction in our 2019 outlook and are well positioned to achieve our 2020 targets and provide further shareholder returns. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Frank for closing commentary. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2018/11/08/norwegian-cruise-line-holdings-ltd-nclh-q3-2018-ea.aspx
