Southwest Airlines (LUV) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 25, 2024","Thank you, Julie, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. As we close the books on 2023, I want to take a moment to reflect on how far we've come. And more importantly, I want to thank the people at Southwest Airlines for their dedication, their warrior spirit, their heart, and ultimately, for their incredible resilience. At this time last year, we were getting back on our feet from the disruption following Winter Storm Elliott. We quickly mobilized to put immediate mitigation efforts in place while simultaneously building a robust plan to prepare us for future extreme winter weather disruptions. We were also working to restore our network, address our staffing needs, and return our aircraft to full utilization. And of course, we were in the middle of negotiations with the majority of our labor unions. I'm incredibly pleased to be on the other side of 2023 and to be able to share all the progress we made last year. We completed a comprehensive winter weather action plan, which has already been successfully tested in multiple weather -- winter weather events, including the types of disruptions, such as hurricanes, severe fog in Chicago, and the Maui fires. Through all of those events, our aircraft and crew networks remained stable. We recovered quickly, and we were able to minimize the impact on our customers. We also got fully staffed, restored our network, and reached full utilization of our fleet. Our network is in a healthy place, and it shows in our operational improvement. In fact, we improved in nearly every operational metric. Our completion factor performance, in particular, was fantastic at 99% for the full year with fourth quarter being our best quarterly performance in more than a decade at 99.6%. We also made significant progress on our labor agreements, including the ratification earlier this week of an agreement that secures industry-leading pay for our best-in-class pilots. We have now successfully reached ratification on providing competitive market compensation packages for our people. This is a huge accomplishment, and I would like to thank all those who have tirelessly supported those negotiations. Of course, all of this was in addition to a host of other accomplishments: the rollout of a new revenue management system, the launch of multiple customer experience improvements, and the negotiation of a very cost-effective order book with Boeing. The order book allows us to continue the modernization of our fleet and provides the opportunity to flex our growth plans up or down over the long term. We also made rapid adjustments to capacity for both 2023 and 2024 and put in place significant network adjustments in response to changing demand patterns. These changes reduced our planned 2024 year-over-year capacity increase to roughly 6%, all of which is carryover from 2023 network restoration. So there will be no net new additional capacity in in 2024 as we work to mature our route network. Moving to our performance, we continue to be very pleased with the core demand for our product. We saw close-in performance strengthened in November and December for both leisure and corporate travel. This led fourth quarter 2023 to be yet another record at just over $6.8 billion in operating revenue, and we are seeing that strength continue into 2024. This demand strength, combined with about $1.5 billion in incremental year-over-year pre-tax profit from our network optimization efforts and the contributions from our portfolio of strategic initiatives is driving us to expect additional revenue records and year-over-year operating margin expansion despite cost pressures from new labor agreements and increased aircraft maintenance expense. Our network changes are materially in place with the March schedule where we expect to hit a profitability inflection point. While still early in the quarter, our initiatives are delivering toward our revenue target, and we expect to exit the quarter with a strong operating margin for the month of March. While we have significant inflationary pressures from our new labor agreements, we have initiatives underway that will begin to help counter these pressures from scheduling techniques to digital modernization, and we plan to end 2024 with headcount flat to down as compared with year-end 2023 as we slow hiring to levels that are at or below our attrition rate that will drive efficiency gains in 2024 with more to come in 2025. All of this supports a solid plan with a line of sight to improve our financial returns and earn our cost of capital in 2024. While this represents notable progress, I want to be clear, earning adequate and consistent returns ROIC well in excess of WACC is our financial North Star, and it's not negotiable. We will be relentless in executing against our plans, and we will continue to make adjustments, including capacity adjustments, if needed, until we deliver those results. Adequate and consistent returns is how we have created decades of shareholder value, and it continues to be our key focus. Our current set of initiatives is tracking nicely, and we will provide you a lot more detail later this year at investor day. In addition, we're working on a next set of initiatives to support and support sustainable returns over time. In closing, we made tremendous progress in 2023, and we finished the year a much stronger company. We will finish this year stronger again. We are fully committed to improving the customer experience and delivering on our long-term financial targets, including generating returns for our shareholders. As always, I have confidence in our people and our business model, and I am particularly proud of our people for their dedication and their resilience. They remain our absolute greatest asset, the heart and soul of our company, and the ultimate source of pride for me. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. ","Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. As Bob mentioned, 2023 wasn't without its challenges, but we are stronger and ready to take on another year, and that is all thanks to our incredible employees. We delivered $986 million in profits for the year, and our fourth quarter net income of $233 million, both when excluding special items, was on the better side of our expectations. We prioritize the restoration of our network and operational reliability in 2023, which has taken a lot of resources and focus. With our operations now stable and the network fully restored, we can direct much more focus and energy to consistently delivering a strong financial performance, along with delivering operational excellence. We have incredible strengths to build upon and the levers we need to optimize and regain our position as an industry leader. We will be steadfast in our efforts to make meaningful progress this year in support of our long-term goal of generating consistent returns well in excess of our cost of capital. Ryan and Andrew will cover the headway we've made with our revenue and operations performance in detail, so I'll start with our cost performance before moving to fleet and balance sheet. Overall, our unit costs, excluding special items, were down 16% year over year in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter average fuel price of $3 per gallon was right at the low end of guidance, primarily due to jet fuel prices and the L.A. market steadying after significantly spiking in mid-November. Thankfully, market prices dropped as we moved into this year, and our fuel price guidance of $2.70 to $2.80 per gallon for the first quarter and $2.55 to $2.65 per gallon for the full year is a welcome reduction in fuel cost compared with 2023. We are currently 60% hedged here in first quarter and 57% hedged for the full year with more meaningful hedge protection kicking in at Brent prices around $90 per barrel. That's a higher strike price than where our 2023 hedges began to provide meaningful protection, which was closer to $70 per barrel. This is reflective of the current market conditions and elevated cost of hedging. We continue to prudently add to our fuel hedge position for 2026, nearing 20% hedged and are currently 46% hedged in 2025, in line with our goal to be roughly 50% hedged in each calendar year. While we are not fully immune to the volatile energy market, I am grateful that our hedging positions provide meaningful protection against catastrophic increases while also allowing us to participate fully when market prices decline. Moving to non-fuel cost. Our fourth quarter year-over-year CASM-X decrease of 18.1% was on the favorable side of our guidance range, driven primarily by elevated operating expenses and lower capacity levels in fourth quarter 2022 as a result of the operational disruption. This was partially offset by general inflationary cost pressures, including higher labor rates for all employee work groups, as well as elevated maintenance expense, both of which are sicky, as we move into 2024. I also want to congratulate our pilots on their newly ratified contract. Obviously, the market for pilot wages has increased significantly, and it is important that we keep pace to reward our employees appropriately. As a result of the new agreement, we recorded a change in estimate for the pilots' ratification bonus, and you can find the details and breakout of the accounting treatment in this morning's press release. Looking to first quarter 2024, we currently estimate our CASM-X to increase in the range of 6% to 7% year over year. Roughly 3 to 4 points of this estimated increase is driven by higher overall 2024 labor cost and market wage rate accruals. The remainder of the first quarter CASM-X increase is primarily due to year-over-year pressure in maintenance expense, driven by rate increases as well as an increase in maintenance activity as our as our 800s are coming off their honeymoon period. Speaking to full-year cost. Our CASM-X guidance of a 6% to 7% increase year over year is also essentially driven by labor and maintenance cost pressures. Roughly 4 to 5 points is attributable to labor, and roughly 2 points is from maintenance for the reasons I previously covered. While we accrue for market wage rates, the recently ratified pilot contract contributes the majority of the labor CASM-X increase this year due to a step-up in wage rates, work rule changes, and enhanced benefits. As Bob mentioned, we are steadfastly focused on regaining efficiencies to help counter some of the structural cost pressures as we look to control what's controllable. We are not satisfied with our current financial performance, and we will work relentlessly until we produce the financial strength and returns you should expect from Southwest Airlines. We have a solid 2024 plan, which includes the benefit of roughly $1.5 billion in incremental year-over-year pre-tax profits from our strategic initiatives. The vast majority of the initiatives delivering value in 2024 are revenue related, contributing well over $1 billion of the $1.5 billion total expected incremental benefit and our network optimization and market maturation efforts are providing the bulk of that revenue lift. The balance of the revenue-generating benefits come from incremental managed business initiatives, primarily increased GDS participation. The incremental cost benefit relates primarily to fleet monetization and early yields from other operating efficiency efforts, such as digital service modernization and our turn initiative. We will go into a lot more detail on our initiative portfolio at investor day later this year. While early, our plan provides significant progress toward our long-term goal to generate ROIC well in excess of our cost of capital. Again, more details to come at our 2024 investor day. Now turning to our fleet. During 2023, we received a total of 86-8 deliveries, more than planned, and retired 39-700 to less than planned, ending the year with a total of 817 aircraft. We consistently mentioned the flexibility in our fleet modernization efforts being a key competitive advantage, and the minor shifting of deliveries and retirements throughout 2023 validates our ability to thoughtfully plan and execute given the continued supply chain challenges facing Boeing. Moving into 2024, there is continued uncertainty around the timing of expected Boeing deliveries and the certification of the MAX 7 aircraft. Our fleet plans remain nimble and currently differs from our contractual order book with Boeing. We are planning for 79 aircraft deliveries this year and expect to retire roughly 45-700 and 4-800, resulting in a net expected increase of 30 aircraft this year. Taking our current plan into consideration, we expect our 2024 capex to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. After finalizing our 2024 plans and refining capacity levels to better reflect the current environment, we now expect full-year 2024 capacity to be up about 6% year over year. And our 2024 capacity plans do not currently include any MAX 7 flying, so a certification of that aircraft continues to push out our 2024 capacity plans will not be impacted. In addition, we are also reducing our total fuel expense with our fleet modernization initiatives as we continue to bring on more fuel-efficient -8 aircraft and retire -700. We saw a nearly 3% year-over-year improvement in fuel efficiency in 2023 and expect continued improvement this year. In addition to fuel savings, our fleet modernization initiative is a key component in reaching our environmental sustainability goals. Lastly, I am proud to report that our balance sheet strength continues to be a financial backbone as we move into another year. We remain the only U.S airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. We ended the year with $11.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, returned $428 million to our shareholders through dividend payments in 2023, paid $85 million to retire debt and finance lease obligations in 2023, and continue to be in a net cash position. We expect to pay a modest $29 million in debt payments this year and continue to expect interest income to well exceed our expected interest expense of $249 million in 2024. So we are pleased to have a plan for significant financial improvement to be made this year. With some major milestones behind us, such as restoring our network, becoming fully staffed, fully utilizing our fleet, and so much more, our sites are set on expanding margins and covering our cost of capital in 2024. And as I close, I'd like to sincerely thank our people for another year of hard work and dedication to the mission and vision of Southwest Airlines. I am so grateful for each and every one of you. You are truly my heroes. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/25/southwest-airlines-luv-q4-2023-earnings-call-trans/
Southwest Airlines (LUV) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 26, 2023","Well, thanks, Julia, and good morning, everyone. Before we jump into the financials, I wanted to acknowledge that there have been heart-wrenching challenges around the world the past several months, and we've had natural disasters in the communities that we serve. Earlier this quarter, I visited our team in Maui and witnessed firsthand the impact from the catastrophic wildfires on the island. Our hearts go out to all those who are suffering, and we're really proud of the support we are providing, including the volunteer efforts of our employees. Now moving to the results. Operating revenues for the third quarter were just over $6.5 billion, up nearly 5% from the same period last year and a third quarter record. Despite the recent uptick in fuel prices and other inflationary pressures, we are again profitable with net income of $240 million, excluding special items. Revenue strength was driven by solid leisure demand throughout the quarter and by managed business continuing to come in largely as expected, and Ryan will share more details with you. But overall, demand remains healthy. As we close out this quarter and look ahead to the end of the year, we are very pleased with our accomplishments. We are running a great operation, reaching significant milestones, completing important initiatives, and delivering great customer experience enhancements. We're making great progress on labor agreements, including yesterday's announcement of a tentative agreement with our incredible flight attendants. The team will walk you through many of these accomplishments. But for now, I want to talk to you about immediate actions we are taking to adapt to the current demand environment and solidify our path to operational and financial excellence. Perhaps the biggest milestone is completion of our network restoration plan in the fourth quarter of this year. Reaching this milestone has obviously been a year's long effort and has taken heroic coordination across the entire organization. It's just incredibly challenging, and I am so appreciative of every single employee. It truly was a whole company accomplishment. With this behind us, however, we are set up really well to focus on optimizing our business. That starts with reflowing the fleet order book to support orderly growth. And to that end, we just announced a new order book with our partner, Boeing, yet another milestone. This sets us up for orderly and measured growth and gives us flexibility to adapt in a dynamic environment. And we have a lot of options as we move forward, and we will plan in a way that allows us both the flexibility to move up or down and this order book, combined with opportunities to retire 700s and modernize our fleet supports that really well. Finally, as we move into 2024, we are carefully evaluating the current macro environment and post-pandemic travel behaviors to create the best possible plan for the company. We are now planning for a sequential quarter-over-quarter decline in nominal ASMs in the first quarter 2024. This will result in capacity growth on a year-over-year basis of approximately 10% to 12%, all of which is carryover from growth this year. Note that this is a reduction from what we shared in July, which was an expectation to grow approximately 14% to 16% on a year-over-year basis. In the back half of 2024, we expect a nominal decline in seats relative to the same period in 2023. Therefore, for the full year, our network plan will focus on absorbing current capacity, maturing development markets, and designing schedules for current travel patterns. This plan offers us the ability to redirect the teams that have worked so effectively to get us staffed and restored to now focus on better optimizing the operation. We will be relentless in our focus to wring out inefficiencies, drive productivity, increase reliability, and our goal to return margins to historic levels. We are still hard at work on both our 2024 and long-term plans, but we are building them with a priority and a focus on generating value, value for our employees, value for our customers, and of course, value for our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call over to Tammy. ","Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. First, I would like to extend another thanks to our wonderful employees for their continued hard work this year, especially in a challenging environment. Ryan and Andrew will speak to our revenue trends and operational performance, so I will jump right to cost. Beginning with fuel, our third quarter jet fuel price was $2.78 per gallon, toward the higher end of our guidance, as crude oil prices consistently rose throughout the quarter, peaking to nearly $100 per barrel in late September, and rising refinery margins added further pressure to our third quarter fuel price. Moving into fourth quarter, we currently estimate our fuel price to be in the $2.90 to $3 per gallon range, which includes an estimated $0.19 of hedging gains. We now estimate our full year 2023 fuel price to be in the $2.85 to $2.95 per gallon range, including $0.14 of hedging gains. The total fair market value of our fuel hedge portfolio for fourth quarter through 2026 is $538 million. We added modestly to our fuel hedge position for 2026 during third quarter. We continue to be roughly 50% hedged in 2023 and are currently 55% hedged in 2024, in line with our goal to be roughly 50% hedged in each calendar year. While we are not immune to rising oil prices, I am grateful that our hedging positions relieve some of the additional pressure. We continue to look for prudent opportunities to build out our hedge position for future years. Moving to nonfuel cost, our third quarter year-over-year CASM-X increase of 4.4% was right in line with our previous guidance range, driven primarily by higher labor rates for all employee work groups and the timing of planned maintenance expenses. Looking ahead to fourth quarter, we currently estimate our CASM-X to decrease significantly year over year. There is a lot of noise in the year-over-year comparisons, and the magnitude of the decrease is primarily due to impacts from elevated operating expenses and lower capacity levels in fourth quarter 2022 as a result of last year's operational disruption. Our guidance range is inclusive of wage rate increases associated with the recently announced tentative agreement with our flight attendants. You can find additional details in this morning's press release. Given inflationary pressures, particularly labor rates, combined with moderated capacity growth, we are expecting increased headwinds to our 2024 year-over-year cost. While we hit major milestones this year, our margins are not where they need to be, and we intend to be relentless until we deliver. We therefore plan to adapt our network and capacity plans to support both a reliable operation and improved returns on investments. Given our company's commitment and history toward maintaining a competitive cost advantage, our goal will always be to manage costs accordingly. Now turning to our fleet, during third quarter, we received a total of 18 -8s deliveries and retired four -700s, ending the quarter with a fleet of 817 total aircraft. And we just finalized a new order book with Boeing which funds our long-term mid-single digit growth plan and provides us the ability to phase out the -700 fleet over time. But really, it gives us just a lot of flexibility. We provided full details on the new order book in this morning's release. We now expect to receive 85 -8s this year and plan to retire 41 -700s. This leaves our net expected increase of 44 aircraft unchanged from our previous guidance. Taking all this into consideration, our 2023 capex outlook remains approximately $3.5 billion. Looking to 2024, reiterating what Bob shared, we are planning for capacity levels that better match the current environment. We now expect 2024 capacity to be up 6% to 8% year over year. With our new order book, we have the fleet flexibility we need to organize the company around a disciplined financial plan, one that we can adjust up or down to adapt to the current environment. We continue to expect our five-year capital spending, on average, to be in line with our previous guidance of roughly $4 billion per year. Lastly, our balance sheet remains strong. We are the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. We have $11.7 billion in cash and short-term investments, and we continue to be in a net cash position. Year to date, we have returned more than $400 million to our shareholders through dividend payment and made debt repayments of nearly $80 million. Closing out the , we expect to pay a modest $7 million in scheduled debt repayments and continue to expect our 2023 interest income to more than offset 2023 interest expense. Let me close by saying I am tremendously proud of our people and their hard work. As we look ahead, it is imperative we remain focused on building our 2024 plans and beyond to provide a resolute path to prosperity for our company, our employees, and our shareholders. We have a history that proves we do not rest on our laurels, and I'm confident we have all the elements needed to bring about the success you should expect from Southwest Airlines. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/26/southwest-airlines-luv-q3-2023-earnings-call-trans/
Southwest Airlines (LUV) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 27, 2023","Thanks Julia, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us for our second quarter 2023 earnings call. I am very pleased to report a solid quarter with net income of $693 million, excluding special items, and all-time record quarterly revenue of just over $7 billion. The demand environment, especially for leisure travel, continues to be resilient as we have seen solid bookings throughout the busy summer travel season. Further, we continue to expect $1 billion to $1.5 billion of pre-tax profit contribution in full year 2023 for our strategic initiatives that we outlined at our investor day last December. Based on our current outlook, we continue to expect record operating revenue and solid profits in third quarter 2023 and year-over-year margin expansion for full year 2023. I especially want to thank our people for doing such a fantastic job. They helped us get a record number of customers and a record number of bags on a record number of flights successfully to their destinations, as we experienced the lowest second quarter flight cancellation rate in the past 10 years. It wasn't without trials. We had a lot going on in the operation related to weather, and weather has continued to be a challenge here in July. Despite that, our employees have continued to deliver a very solid performance. From our network ops control center to the front line, our people have worked together extremely well to minimize cancellations and produce a very reliable operation, and I'm just so proud of them for getting our customers where they need to go, despite a challenging operational environment. While our cost outlook has increased for the year, the change is primarily driven by updates to our market wage rate accruals for open collective bargaining agreements. And while fluid, we're making progress. It's obviously very hard work and I'm just very appreciative of the dedication of everybody involved in the negotiation process. Now, thinking about where we are with the business, since 2018, we have seen very significant swings due to the grounding of the MAX, demand fall off, of course, from COVID, then the stress from the resurgence of demand, disruptions from post-pandemic supply chain issues, challenges with employee staffing, and most recently, uncertainty with our Boeing aircraft deliveries. The challenges we have faced since 2018 have made planning difficult, so smoothing out fluctuations is a must, and the best way to do that is with smooth and predictable capacity growth. We told you back in April that we were reflowing our order book to allow for orderly and measured growth, and we're still finalizing the details of that with Boeing, but we remain confident that we will get the 70 deliveries in 2023 that are assumed for our published schedules, and we are working to build a 2024 plan that should be much more stable. We currently are planning to be flying the MAX 7 at some point next year, but if not, we'll take MAX 8 instead just as we are doing now. Where that leaves us for full year 2023 capacity is unchanged for this year at up 14% to 15% year over year. As we shared this morning in our release, we are revamping our 2024 flight schedules. While our network is largely restored at this point, it is not optimized, especially for post-pandemic shifts in business travel. Those adjustments to the network will be largely complete by the March 2024 flight schedules, and we expect those efforts and the continued maturation of development markets to generate an incremental $500 million in pre-tax profit in 2024. The changes will also reduce the percentage of system capacity and development by more than half, returning to normal pre-pandemic levels by the end of next year. We already have our schedule published through March 6, 2024, and currently expect first quarter 2024 capacity to be up in the range of 14% to 16% on a year-over-year basis. Now, keep in mind that nearly 90% of that year-over-year growth is carryover from 2023. For the remainder of 2024, we are planning for a sequential deceleration in year-over-year growth in each quarter next year as we work our way back to our long-term goal of mid-single-digit growth year over year. We've made a lot of progress in the first half of 2023, completing several major milestones. We quickly developed and are on track for our winter operations plan. We have the staffing plan in place to fully utilize our fleet by the end of the third quarter and have the network restored by the end of the year. Again, to be clear, it's restored but not yet optimized, and Ryan will share more on how we're going to adjust the network based on post-pandemic travel patterns. But we have a lot of exciting things in the works that we believe are going to contribute to our 2024 financial results and help us deliver another year of margin expansion next year. In closing, our accomplishments in 2023 lay a foundation for us to shift our focus to restoring our industry-leading financial and operational performance, boost our operational resilience, and make advances in our industry-leading customer service through a focus on digital hospitality. I just can't say this enough, I'm just so proud of our people. They are the heart of Southwest Airlines, and they deliver day in and day out for each other and for our customers. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. ","Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. First, I'd like to extend another thanks to our employees for their commendable efforts this quarter, resulting in solid operational and financial performance, a hard earned improvement from where we began the year. Overall, we had a really solid quarter. Operationally, we had a great completion factor, despite many weather challenges. Financially, bottom line profits were in line with our expectations, despite pressure from market-driven labor accruals. We produced an all-time quarterly operating revenue record. We also generated double-digit operating margins each month during the quarter. All of this was made possible by the drive and hard work of our incredible employees. I just can't thank them enough. Ryan and Andrew will speak to our revenue trends and operational performance. So, I will jump right to cost, fleet and then balance sheet. Beginning with fuel, our second quarter jet fuel price was $2.60 per gallon, slightly above our previous guidance. Throughout second quarter, crude oil prices stayed within a reasonable range, hovering for the most part around $80 per barrel. We are 49% hedged for third quarter and estimate our third quarter fuel price to be similar to our second quarter fuel price. And that includes an estimated $0.08 of hedging gains. We now estimate our full year 2023 fuel price to be in the $2.70 to $2.80 per gallon range, including $0.09 of hedging gains. This is up a dime from our previous guidance due to higher refining margins. Of course, market oil prices and heating cracks can be volatile, which is why we hedge. We are currently 54% hedged in 2024, and over the last few months, we've added meaningfully to our 2025 portfolio and began building our 2026 portfolio. The total fair market value of our fuel hedge portfolio for third quarter through 2026 is $373 million. We will continue to see seek cost effective opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio with a continued goal to get to roughly 50% hedging protection each year. Moving to non-fuel cost, our second quarter year-over-year CASM-X increase of 7.5% was toward the unfavorable end of our guidance range due to incremental adjustments to market wage rate accruals for our open labor agreements. We have said this from the beginning, but our labor accruals are based on market, and in this environment market has obviously been dynamic. We are planning and eager to award our work groups with well-deserved compensation increases. Looking ahead, our nominal third quarter cost trends remain fairly consistent with second quarter. We currently estimate our third quarter CASM-X to increase in the 3.5% to 6.5% range year over year. This increase is again largely driven by higher labor costs. We are also continuing to incur additional maintenance expense relative to 2022 for our -800 fleet as more engines come due for heavy maintenance, adding further pressure to our second half cost inflation. For our full year 2023, we now estimate CASM-X to decrease in the range of 1% to 2% year over year compared with our previous guidance of down 2% to 4%. The estimated 0.5 increase is due primarily to higher labor cost pressures as I've already covered. Turning to our fleet, during second quarter, we received a total of 21 aircraft deliveries and retired 11 -700 aircraft, ending the quarter with over 800 aircraft. We are working to reflow our order book with Boeing. However, for this year, we continue to plan for approximately 70 -8 deliveries and 26 -700 retirements, which takes the fleet to 814 aircraft at year-end. Likewise, our capex outlook remains unchanged at approximately $3.5 billion, which assumes approximately $2.3 billion in aircraft capital spend. Our 2023 capacity guidance also remains unchanged. We continue to expect full year 2023 capacity to be up approximately 14% to 15% year over year, and we have tightened our third quarter capacity guidance to be up approximately 12% year over year. As Bob mentioned, we are planning for first quarter 2024 capacity to grow 14% to 16% year over year. Now, keep in mind, we are growing 14% to 15% in 2023, and that alone drives nearly 90% of that first quarter year-over-year growth. So, the primary driver of that first quarter year-over-year growth is annualizing the additional capacity we are adding this year. But, our long-term goal remains mid-single-digit year-over-year growth. Lastly, our balance sheet remains pristine and we remain the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. We ended second quarter with cash and short-term investments of $12.2 billion, net of $67 million in debt repayments for the first half of the year. We continue to be in a net cash position and expect a modest $16 million in scheduled debt repayments for the remainder of the year. And currently, 2023 interest income is still expected to more than offset 2023 interest expense. We declared another dividend in second quarter which was paid just a couple of weeks ago. I am proud of what we have accomplished through the first half of the year. That said, we still have work to do to return to industry-leading financial performance, which is our priority as we work on our plans for next year. This includes managing the ongoing inflationary cost pressures, reflowing our order book with Boeing to support orderly, measured and profitable growth, and rebalancing and optimizing our network. We believe these plans, combined with our existing initiatives and the maturation of our development markets will help us expand both margins and return on invested capital in 2024 as compared with this year. Let me close by saying my confidence in our ability to achieve our financial and operational goals is anchored by my belief in the people of Southwest Airlines and their ability to create and inspire success. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/07/27/southwest-airlines-luv-q2-2023-earnings-call-trans/
Southwest Airlines (LUV) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 27, 2023","Thank you, Ryan, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We incurred a first quarter net loss that was in line with our expectations, driven by a $380 million pre-tax negative financial impact related to the December operational disruption, roughly $325 million of that was from lower revenue in January and February, much of that cancellations of holiday return trips. We saw a strong rebound in revenue trends in March, resulting in record first quarter revenues despite the impact of the December disruption. Travel demand remained strong thus far, but we remain mindful of the uncertain economic environment. You have to be given all the headlines and trends we are seeing across many industries. We have tough year-over-year revenue comparisons here in the second quarter with last year's domestic revenue environment getting a boost from international closures. Taking that into consideration, demand, particularly leisure continues to show strength as we head into the busy summer travel season. Our cost outlook is higher this year due to a few moving parts, as we are making additional investments in the operation based on our learnings from December. I won't go through all of our key findings and work to shore up our winter preparedness because we've done that a few times now, I am very proud of our people for the operation they have delivered this year and for the relentless focus on executing our plan to fortify the operation in preparation for winter 2023. Despite the near-term cost pressures, we have not lost focus on our goal to effectively manage the real inflationary cost increases we are seeing and equally as important, maintain our competitive cost position. As we look ahead, we currently expect solid profits here in Q2. We continue to expect solid profits for full year with the goal to grow full year margins and ROIC year over year, as well as have our route network roughly restored by year-end. We are reducing our full year 2023 growth plans due to a lower planning assumption for Boeing MAX deliveries this year. This relates to the recent news of further supply chain challenges at Boeing. The outcome is a reduction to our 2023 capacity and capex outlook, and we are currently reevaluating our hiring needs relative to our most recent expectation to hire more than 7,000 net new employees this year. We will be moderating our overall hiring plans as we get into the second half of 2023. In the meantime, we are most focused on revisions to our second half 2023 flight schedules to account for fewer aircraft, which Andrew will cover in more detail. I'm very proud of the progress we are making on our customer experience enhancements. As a reminder, we are investing in three onboard initiatives, enhanced Wi-Fi, in-seat power and larger overhead bins. In early March, our first new aircraft with hardware from our new Wi-Fi provider, Viasat, entered revenue service. By third quarter, we expect all of our existing aircraft to be flying with upgraded Wi-Fi and Anuvu hardware, offering increased speed and reliability. So just great progress on that front. Our new MAX 8 deliveries are coming into service with in-seat power and larger overhead bins. So, those are already entering service as well. We're also very-focused on mobile and other enhancements on our technology road map to offer more self-service options for our customers to give them more flexibility and ease during their journey. Highlighting one of our stronghold markets, Southwest is the No. 1 airline in Kansas City, growing from six flights in 1982 to 75 flights today. And I'm proud to say that our service in Kansas City is now fully restored the pre-pandemic levels. We recently celebrated the opening of the new Kansas City Airport in February, and we serve as the Chair of the Airport and Airlines Affairs Committee. We really appreciated the opportunity to partner with the airport to deliver a beautiful new terminal that will serve us and the community well for a very long period of time. It was a great partnership all the way around, and it is a beautiful facility. We continue to work hard on labor agreements for our people and we continue to make progress. We just reached a tentative agreement with TWU 550, which represents our Meteorologists, and I want to commend both negotiating committees for the spirit of cooperation that led to that agreement. We remain focused on negotiations with the union representing our ramp in ops employees and mediation with unions representing our pilots and flight attendants and remain committed to competitive market compensation packages for our people. We are very eager to get new contracts and have a significant amount of wage rate increases and have already been accrued and set aside and we look forward to rewarding those remaining groups soon. In closing, I'm just so very proud of our people. They are the hardest Southwest Airlines, and they deliver day in and day out for each other and for our customers. And despite the negative impacts in Q1, we believe we still have a solid plan for 2023. We are carefully managing the business in the near term, and we continue to believe in our long-term strategy and set of initiatives. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. ","Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. Our first quarter loss is disappointing and not how we hope to start 2023. However, the quarter was not without notable accomplishments. Our ontime performance year-to-date through March was solid. Our operations team navigated through a stream of difficult weather conditions successfully with no material impact to our network performance. And despite the negative revenue impact from December operational disruption, we still had record first quarter passenger revenues and record other revenue. We also ended the quarter with strong double-digit margins for the month of March despite high fuel prices. All of this was made possible by the drive and hard work of our incredible employees. Ryan and Andrew will speak to our revenue and operations performance and outlook, so I will jump right in to our cost performance and outlook. Beginning with fuels. Our first quarter jet fuel price was $3.19 per gallon, which was on the high end of our guidance range. Throughout first quarter, crude oil prices stayed within a reasonable range, while prices dipped to about $65 per barrel in mid-March, they primarily hovered around $80 per barrel throughout first quarter. On the other hand, refining margins remained volatile during first quarter after hitting a 10-year high last year. Thankfully, market prices have fallen over recent weeks, in particular, crack spreads, which is a welcome relief. We are 51% hedged for our second quarter and estimate our second quarter fuel price to be in the $2.45 to $2.55 per gallon range, which is roughly $0.69 lower than our first quarter fuel price. That includes an estimated $0.13 of hedging gains, which equates to cost savings of roughly $70 million in second quarter alone. We now estimate our full year 2023 fuel price to be in the $2.60 to $2.70 per gallon range, down a nickel from our previous guidance and still including $0.10 of hedging gains. Of course, this is a snapshot of our fuel guidance based on the April 19th forward curve and market oil prices and heating cracks can be volatile, which is why we hedge. We recently added to our 2024 fuel hedge portfolio and are now 51% hedged next year as well. We began building our 2025 portfolio and are about 10% hedged. The total market value of our fuel hedge portfolio for second quarter 2023 through 2025 is $418 million. We will continue to see cost-effective opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio with a continued goal to get to roughly 50% hedging protection each year. Moving to nonfuel costs. Our first quarter year over year CASM-X increase of 5.9% was in line with our guidance range. As expected, we experienced inflationary cost pressures, primarily higher labor costs, including market wage rate accruals for all employee groups, as well as increased technology spending and higher rates for airport and benefit costs. The remainder of the increase was primarily driven by operational disruption related expenses. Looking ahead, we currently estimate our second quarter CASM-X to increase in the 5% to 8% range year over year, largely driven by general inflationary cost pressures that we expect to persist and are not unique to Southwest. In addition to higher labor rates, we continue to accrue for market wage rate increases for the remaining open labor contracts. And as we further refine our multiyear maintenance planning, we have additional maintenance expense this year for our -800 fleet as more engines come due for heavy maintenance and this is adding further pressure to our second quarter cost inflation. For full year 2023, we now estimate CASM-X to decrease in the range of 2% to 4% year over year compared with our previous guidance of down 3.5% to 5.5%. Approximately one point of this year-over-year increase is due to lower capacity as a result of Boeing delivery delays and the remainder of the change in guidance is driven by the timing of maintenance expenses for our -800 fleet, a continuation of what we are experiencing here in the second quarter. As a reminder, our full year CASM-X guidance continues to include higher labor rates, including market wage rate accruals for the remaining open labor contracts, as well as the estimated tens of millions of dollars of additional investments we expect to incur toward our operational resiliency. Turning to our fleet. We received a total of 30 aircraft deliveries during first quarter as expected, ending the quarter with 793 aircraft, which is a net of seven -700 retirements, two more than previously planned as we shifted up a couple of retirements from the second half of this year. Looking at the full year, based on the recent production issues at Boeing, we feel it's prudent to have a more conservative planning assumption and are now planning around 70 -8 aircraft deliveries in 2023 compared with our previous assumption of approximately 90 -8 deliveries. As a result, we have lowered our full year 2023 capacity guidance by roughly one point to up 14% to 15% year over year, which impacts our second half capacity assumptions closely and fourth quarter. As a reminder, we have a surplus of underutilized aircraft and our fleet due to pilot hiring constraints. Therefore, the reduction in our delivery should not impact our summer flight schedule. We continue to expect our second quarter capacity to be up 14% year over year. Our planned deliveries continue to differ from our contractual order book. In addition to the recent aircraft delivery delays, which are not reflected in our contractual order book, we continue to reflect 46 undelivered 2022 contractual aircraft deliveries as 2023 deliveries in the order book, further outlined in our press release. But to be very clear, we are currently planning our published schedules around the delivery of 70 -8 aircraft this year, and we intend to solidify our order book with Boeing soon. In regards to our current capex outlook for this year, we now estimate to spend approximately $3.5 billion, reflecting our updated delivery assumptions of 70 aircraft this year compared with our previous guidance of approximately $4 billion, which assumes roughly 90 aircraft deliveries. Lastly, a quick note on our balance sheet. We ended first quarter with cash and short-term investments of $11.7 billion after paying $59 million to retire debt and finance lease obligations in first quarter. We continue to expect a modest $85 million in scheduled debt repayments for full year 2023, including roughly $10 million in scheduled debt repayments here in second quarter. We also paid $214 million in dividends in the first quarter as our pre-pandemic dividend is fully restored. And based on our current expectations, we continue to expect 2023 interest income to more than offset 2023 interest expense. We continue to be in a net cash position, and we continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. In closing, this was not the first quarter performance we had planned back at investor day. However, I am immensely proud of our people and their perseverance. There is still work to be done to fully recover, but we are currently forecasting a substantial improvement sequentially to the bottom line with solid profitability this quarter. We are laser-focused on managing ongoing inflationary cost increases, regaining better operating leverage and maintaining our competitive cost advantage. We have not lost sight of our goals or the warrior spirit of Southwest Airlines, and I'm eager to move forward along our path of success for many years to come. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/04/28/southwest-airlines-luv-q1-2023-earnings-call-trans/
Southwest Airlines (LUV) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 26, 2023","All right. Thank you, Ryan, and I appreciate everybody joining us this morning. Well, we're disappointed to report a Q4 net loss as we were on track to produce a healthy fourth quarter profit prior to December the 21st. We provided an 8-K investor update earlier this month that quantified the preliminary estimate of the financial impacts, so a Q4 loss is likely not a surprise. But I would like to take a few minutes to talk about the operational disruptions. And first and foremost, I want to apologize again to our customers and our employees for the impact the operational disruption had on them and on their holiday plans. We are intensely focused on reducing the risk of repeating that type of operational event again like we had last month, and we are highly focused on our customers and our plan going forward. And customer refunds and reimbursements remain a top focus. While I'm not proud of what happened, I am very proud of our people and all that they have done to take care of our customers and their needs. Well, in terms of the events themselves, we canceled more than 16,700 flights from December the 21st to December 31st. The first few days through December the 23rd were specific to the winter storm, and we began to have additional disruptions in the operation on December the 24th. As the largest carrier in roughly half of the top 50 U.S. travel markets, we were impacted by rolling storms to an extraordinary degree. We experienced gridlock in many of our largest airports, along with a high frequency of short-notice cancellations, which created urgent and repeating efforts to repair the aircraft routings and then our pilot and flight attendant schedules. Given the overwhelming volume of flight cancellations over multiple days, combined with manual work streams, we determined that the best course of action to get back on track operationally was to reduce our December 27th through December 29th flight activity by roughly two-thirds. And that allowed us time to reset the operation to normal flight levels beginning on December the 30th. But based on what we know at this point, our processes and technology generally worked as designed. We were hit by an overwhelming volume of closing cancellations, which put us behind in creating crew solutions, which, in turn, pushed us to manual efforts and solutions. And Andrew will cover that in detail more here in just a minute. So, we've got several streams of work underway. Immediately following the disruption, we moved swiftly to put mitigation efforts in place to reduce the risk of future operational disruptions and help fortify our operational resilience. We created an early indicator dashboard that closely monitors operational health and signals an alert if we approach predefined operational thresholds. We establish supplemental operational staffing that can quickly mobilize to support crew recovery efforts at the first sign of a potential workload backlog. We enhanced our existing tools for crew members to communicate electronically to crew scheduling during regular operations. And we're in the process of swiftly updating and upgrading our crew recovery tools and system to solve the backlogged repair of crew member schedules, which was one of the key issues during the disruption. While these short-term risk mitigation steps in place are underway, we're taking additional steps to review the events and determine any additional changes to our plans. We worked early on with our board of directors, and they've established an operations review committee and is working with our management to understand the events and help oversee the company's response. We've engaged a third-party global aviation firm, Oliver Wyman, for a third-party assessment of the event and help make recommendations of additional mitigation elements for us to consider. And that work will conclude here over the next several weeks. And with that assessment and our own, we will reassess our 2023 plans, keeping in mind that we already had a robust operational modernization plan in place for 2023. And Andrew will walk you through that in greater detail as well. I want to reiterate that Southwest has a very long history of innovation and continuous improvement. We've been investing up to 1 billion per year on technology, both recurring and investment spend included. And we have implemented numerous large-scale technology and business projects over the past five years, including things like the first implementation of the Amadeus reservation system in North America, co-developing an innovative network planning system that's now part of the Amadeus product portfolio; ETOPS certification and processes for Hawaii flying; new aircraft maintenance systems, a GDS platform capabilities in connection to three other platforms, a new fare product; and automated ancillary services capabilities; and we're in the process of ramping up the replacement of our revenue management system, which actually involves three RM systems simultaneously in production, which is an absolute technical feat. That list is not meant to be comprehensive but hopefully gives you an idea of what we've done and what's underway. We're also currently budgeted to spend 1.3 billion of our 2023 annual operating plan on investments, upgrade, and maintenance of our IT systems, which is higher than what we spent in 2022. The recent disruptions will likely accelerate some of our plans to enhance our processes and technology, but I suspect that the operational modernization opportunities that Andrew outlined in investor day have largely captured the key work streams, and we will dedicate the capital needed to execute in a timely and efficient manner. We currently plan to stick with our 2023 growth plans. We were properly staffed for our 2022 flight schedules, including the holidays, and we continue hiring this year to be properly staff for our 2023 flight schedules. Our plans call for adding over 7,000 new employees in 2023, which is actually a decrease of nearly 40% from 2022 hiring levels. We have the order book from Boeing that we need in 2023. And with the short-term mitigation elements that we put in place, we believe we are well prepared to execute our network restoration plans this year. Nearly all planned 2023 capacity additions will go to restoring the network, adding breadth and depth in existing Southwest markets. And that network restoration should significantly help our operational resilience efforts over the long term. Andrew will also cover that in more detail. Finally, we continue to work hard on labor agreements for our people, and I'm very proud of the fact that we were able to reach agreements with several of our unions recently, including our flight instructors, our facilities maintenance techs, our customer service agents, and, just earlier this week, a tentative agreement with our dispatchers. We continued to negotiations with the unions representing our ramp and ops employees and mediation with unions representing our pilots and flight attendants. And we intend, as always, to have competitive market compensation packages for our people. In closing, we still made tremendous progress in 2022. And despite some impact here in Q1, we believe we still have a solid plan for 2023. We are holding ourselves accountable to the plans that we outlined at our early December investor day, and it is still our goal to achieve the long-term financial targets that we outlined. And I know that our people are up to the task. I'm just extremely proud of them for their dedication to the cause that is Southwest Airlines, and they remain absolutely our greatest asset, the heart and soul of the company, and a tremendous source of pride for me personally. And with that, I will turn it over to Andrew. ","Thank you, Andrew. And hello, everyone. I will provide a quick overview of our financial results and share some additional color on our 2023 outlook. As a result of the operational disruptions in late December, driving a 620 million negative after-tax net impact, we reported a fourth quarter net loss of 226 million, excluding special items. These results are clearly disappointing and not where we expect it to be. Our quarterly performance leading up to December 21st was strong and trending in line with our previous guidance expectations, aside from CASM-X, which I will cover in a minute. As Bob mentioned, we still made tremendous progress in 2022 despite the operational setback in late December, generating full year 2022 net income of 723 million, excluding special items. Despite the negative revenue impact from the flight cancellations in December, we generated record fourth quarter operating revenues. Brian will speak to our revenue performance and outlook here shortly, so I will turn to our cost performance and outlook. Beginning with fuel, our fuel hedge performed well last year, especially in a volatile market environment. In total, our full year 2022 fuel hedge benefit was roughly 950 million, with roughly 170 million in fuel expense savings in the fourth quarter alone. For 2023, we are 56% hedged in first quarter, 51% hedged in the second quarter, and 47% hedged in second half 2023, which equates to 50% hedged for the full year. Based on the January 20th forward curve, we now estimate our first quarter fuel price to be in the $3.25 to $3.35 per gallon range, up $0.25 from our previous guidance, and our full year 2023 fuel price to be in the $2.90 to $3 per gallon range, up a nickel from our previous guidance. Our first quarter guidance includes $0.16 of hedging gain and a hedging premium expense of $0.06 per gallon. We recently added to our 2024 fuel hedge portfolio and are now 39% hedged with a fair market value of nearly 561 million in total for 2023 and 2024. We will continue to seek cost-effective opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio in 2024 with a goal to get to roughly 50% hedging protection. Moving to our nonfuel costs, we experienced a significant cost increase in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of the December operational disruptions, including a lower capacity from the flight cancellations. The year-over-three-year negative impact to fourth quarter CASM, excluding special items, fuel, and profit sharing, or CASM-X, was 23 points. In addition to the impact from lower ASM, the majority of this headwind was driven by the estimated redemption value of Rapid Reward points offered to customers impacted as a gesture of goodwill and travel expense reimbursements to customers. There was also premium pay and additional compensation for employees, but that made up a much smaller portion of the 23-point CASM-X impact. Excluding the impact from the operational disruptions, our fourth quarter CASM-X was roughly 4 points higher than the high end of our previous guidance range of up 14% to 18% compared with fourth quarter 2019. This was primarily due to additional labor accruals at year-end. As a reminder, we have been accruing for all open labor contracts since April 1, 2022, and these accruals are dynamic as we continuously evaluate market compensation. Looking forward, we continue to experience year-over-year inflationary cost pressures, as well as cost headwinds due to operating at suboptimal productivity levels. We now estimate first quarter CASM-X to increase in the range of 2% to 4% year over year, which is approximately 2 points higher than our previous guidance of flat to up 2%. This 2 point increase is due to the continuation of premium pay for a portion of January relating to the December operational disruption, as well as an increase in labor accruals for open contracts. For our full year 2023, we now estimate CASM-X to decrease in the range of 6% to 8% year over year compared with previous guidance of down 1 to 3%. The vast majority of the change in guidance is related to the year-over-year impact from lower fourth quarter 2022 capacity, as well as higher fourth quarter 2022 costs attributable to the December 2022 operational disruption. We have also increased our labor accruals this year, which results in a slight offset year over year. Putting aside the effects of the December operational disruptions, we continue to expect our second half 2023 CASM-X trend to improve from first half 2023 year over year. Turning to our fleet, we ended 2022 with 770 aircraft, which is net of 26 -700 retirements. We received a total of 68 aircraft deliveries from Boeing, all MAX 8, which was two more than our previous expectation of 66 aircraft. However, we are still short 46 aircraft from the 114 contractually scheduled 2022 MAX deliveries due to Boeing supply chain challenges and the timing of the -7 certification. The 46 orders are reflected as 2023 deliveries in the order book included in our press release this morning. However, we don't expect to be caught up on MAX deliveries by the end of this year. We continue to expect 100 MAX -8 this year, which remains our planning assumption. And we continue to expect to retire 27 -700 aircraft, which will bring our fleet count to 843 at the end of this year. We have also recently exercised option for delivery in 2024, as outlined in our press release. Our full year 2022 capex was 3.9 billion, relatively in line with our previous guidance. In regards to our capex plans for this year, we continue to estimate the spend to be in the range of 4 billion to 4.5 billion, which includes 1.2 billion in non aircraft capital spending. Bob and Andrew touched on our current thoughts regarding technology spend this year in light of the operational disruption. But I want to reiterate that we are focused on executing our operational modernization plans outlined at investor day, which includes our current expectation to spend approximately 1.3 billion this year, including both capital and recurring spend on technology investments, upgrades, and system maintenance. And our total capex range should allow for additional capex investment as needed. Moving to our balance sheet, we ended the year with cash and short-term investments of 12.3 billion after paying a total of 3.1 billion to retire 2.9 billion of principal, a debt and finance lease obligations during 2022. This includes the 1.2 billion principal prepayment of our 2023 notes, which leaves a modest 85 million in scheduled debt repayments this year. Our leverage is at a very manageable 47%, which we expect to decline over the next several years. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. In closing, I am immensely proud of the progress our people made throughout 2022 and their continued resiliency through numerous unexpected challenges. While the last several weeks have been tough, we have not lost sight of the priorities and focus areas that we outlined at investor day. In addition to the operational modernization plans we already mentioned, we are eager to wrap up negotiations with all of our open-contract labor groups. Although it's disappointing, we expect another loss in first quarter this year due to a carryover revenue drag from the operational disruption, we remain steadfast in our focus to generate consistent quarterly profitability. And even with the first quarter headwind, our 2023 plan continues to support solid profits with year-over-year margin expansion for full year 2023. Furthermore, we remain determined to achieve our long-term financial targets to grow our profits, margins, and returns while delivering on our commitment to provide outstanding customer service and reliable operations that have been a source of tremendous pride over our 51-year history. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/01/26/southwest-airlines-luv-q4-2022-earnings-call-trans/
Southwest Airlines (LUV) Q3 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 27, 2022","All right. Well, thank you, Ryan, and I appreciate everybody joining us this morning. I'm just really pleased to report another solid profit in the third quarter of $316 million, excluding special items, or $0.50 a share. All in all, third quarter's bottom line results came in almost right in line with our expectations back in July, slightly better, in fact, and that really speaks to the more stable environment that we are operating in today versus where we were just two quarters ago. While not fully recovered yet, it makes a big difference in our ability to more effectively plan, set our flight schedules and avoid revising them and deliver a more reliable operation both for our customers and our employees. That's exactly what we're doing in the second half of 2022, and that's what we plan to do going forward. Given the significant progress we've made thus far, we do not intend to republish or materially change our future flight schedules as was necessary to do during most of the pandemic. One of our primary goals for this year is returning to consistent profitability, and we are well on our way and continue to expect a solid profit for 2022. We are coming off of a record third quarter revenues, and bookings appear strong as far as we can see in our booking curve. Demand trends, both volumes, and yields, are robust. We want to get properly staffed, and that's going very well. We remain on track with adding over 10,000 new employees this year, net of attrition, and we are getting much better staffed in key areas with the exception of pilots, where our aggressive hiring efforts continue. And we are on track to hire 1,200 pilots this year and 2,100 pilots next year as planned. we wanted to restore our operational reliability, and we are headed in the right direction, having made a lot of solid progress. As we shared previously, we restored some of our short-haul flying in the third quarter, which was a little early and at the expense of revenue now knowing where business demand has ended up. But the goal was to help the operation, and I believe we got the desired results in the third quarter. Going forward, we believe we have capacity better matched seasonally to demand in the fourth quarter, and you can see the benefit in our sequential revenue improvement from 3Q to 4Q based on our guidance. And as Mike will cover, our on-time performance this month has been very strong with high completion rates. And the thanks, of course, goes to our people who have thoughtfully restored our customer service advantage this year, another one of our top priorities. For January through August, the most recent data available, we remain No. 1 in customer service for the DOT's ranking for marketing carriers. I'm just so thankful for our employees and how they have worked tirelessly together as a team, no matter the obstacle, and they have us solidly back on top of the industry. Again, our employees are the central proof and essence here of Southwest Airlines, and I'm just so very proud of them and all that they have done. Jet fuel prices remain high, but we are 61% hedged in the fourth quarter and continue to expect healthy hedging gains. We continue to expect both inflationary cost pressures and cost headwinds from lower productivity and efficiency in fourth quarter. This was all anticipated in our full year guidance. And other than some timing of costs between 3Q and 4Q, our cost trends have been very stable. We've been executing well on our full year 2022 cost plan since we provided our full year CASM-X guidance back in January. And but for the Hurricane Ian impact to capacity, we are also executing on our full year 2022 capacity plan. Specific areas of focus for 2023 are to maintain adequate staffing and get caught up in pilot staffing, get new contracts with all labor groups currently in negotiations, fully utilize our aircraft and optimize staffing to the fleet and flight activity, bring out cost inefficiencies and improve efficiency levels and operating leverage as we fully restore the network. Our primary gating factor to growth next year continues to be pilot hiring, and I don't expect that we will be fully utilizing the fleet until late 2023. As of today, our flight schedules are published through July 10, 2023, and we feel good about our ability to fly those schedules as published and planned despite some uncertainty around aircraft deliveries. While we expect a healthy amount of capacity growth next year, it is nearly all going back into key Southwest markets. These are markets that we borrowed from to fund new airport expansion during the pandemic. And as business demand improves, we have opportunities to build those backup. And this is lower-risk growth primarily in markets where we have the No. 1 share and a strong Southwest customer base, so we don't believe the capacity additions carry near the risk of adding a new market. Our goal is to have the network fully restored by the end of 2023. And by summer 2023, we should be about 90% done. In closing, we've made tremendous progress this year, barring any significant unforeseen impacts, we should finish this year very strong given our fourth quarter outlook. While there's noise regarding whether we are headed into a recession or not or whether we may even be in one now, we have not seen any noticeable impact on our booking and revenue trends. There's also been a lot of discussion about the blending of business and leisure, why and where those trends may ultimately end up. But regardless, our overall revenue trends are strong and well above 2019 levels. Our work continues on developing a strong financial plan for next year, and we will share more about that at our upcoming Investor Day meeting in December. And I'm extremely proud of our employees for their dedication to the cause at Southwest Airlines. They're our greatest asset, our secret weapon. They're the best in the business, and I know I can count on them to rally together and help us improve further in 2023. And before I turn it over to Tammy, I just want to say a big thank you to Mike. Mike has overseen the operations here at Southwest for over 16 years, and that is just a huge job and a huge task. He is a tremendous leader. I'm just very grateful, Mike, for all that you do. And I'm very grateful that you will continue to work as an advisor to me and others in the future. And I also want to say a big congrats to Andrew to Linda and to Ryan for taking even more. I really appreciate that. And today, Mike will report on operations, and Andrew will report on commercial. And then beginning at our December Investor Day, Andrew will speak to operations, and you will hear from Ryan regarding our commercial plans. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. ","Thank you, Bob, and thank you, Mike, my very good friend, for 3 decades of incredible leadership. And thanks also to all of our employees for their remarkable job throughout the quarter. In addition to delivering a high-quality experience for our customers, their efforts led to a solid third quarter performance. The strong demand trends from summer continued in third quarter, resulted in record third quarter revenue and record third quarter revenue passengers. Our third quarter operating revenues grew a healthy 10.3% versus 2019, aided by a very strong other revenue performance. Andrew will speak to our revenue trends in a minute, so I will turn to our cost performance and outlook. Our people did another great job managing costs in the quarter. Our fuel hedge continues to perform well in this environment where market prices remain volatile and elevated, saving the company about $220 million in fuel expense in third quarter alone. We are 61% hedged for fourth quarter, and we currently estimate our fourth quarter fuel price to be in the $3.15 to $3.25 per gallon range, which would be a sequential improvement from third quarter's fuel price based on current prices. That estimate includes $0.37 of hedging gains, which equates to cost savings of more than $185 million in fourth quarter, which would put our full year 2022 fuel hedge benefit at roughly $1 billion. We recently added to our 2023 fuel hedge portfolio and are now 50% hedged, with a fair market value of around $390 million for full year 2023. The fair market value of our fuel hedge portfolio through 2024 is $685 million. We will continue to seek opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio in 2024 and beyond, but we are in good shape headed into next year, especially given the volatile energy market over the past year that made it tough to materially expand our positions at historical premium cost. Taking a look at nonfuel cost, third quarter CASM, excluding special items and profit sharing, was toward the favorable end of our previous guidance range at up 12.2%, compared with third quarter 2019 due to lower-than-anticipated health and benefit costs as well as higher favorable airport settlements that we expected to receive this quarter but shifted earlier to third quarter. We currently estimate fourth quarter CASM-X to increase in the range of 14% to 18% compared with fourth quarter 2019. More than half of that increase continues to be driven by headwinds from operating at suboptimal productivity levels, compounded by decreased capacity levels here in fourth quarter relative to third quarter. The remainder of the CASM-X increase continues to be primarily attributable to inflationary pressures, primarily in higher rates for labor, benefits and airports. All of that said, I am very pleased that we remain on track with our '22 cost plans, as Bob mentioned, especially in this environment. As we close out the year, our full year 2022 CASM-X guidance has narrowed to up 14% to 15% compared with 2019. As a reminder, this includes labor accruals for all contract labor groups beginning April 1st of this year, taking into account our best estimate for wage rate increases. Looking ahead to 2023, we continue to estimate full year CASM-X to decrease compared with this year. We now have our first half 2023 flight schedule pushed for sale, and we currently expect first half 2023 CASM-X to be in the range of flat to up 2% compared with first half 2022. Given the level of first half capacity growth, in a pre-pandemic period, we would have expected CASM-X to be subtly down year over year. However, we expect to continue experiencing unprecedented cost headwinds due to higher-than-expected inflation. And as part of that, keep in mind that we are accruing for all open labor contracts and further wage rate increases in 2023. So that is fully included in our guidance based on our best estimation of market rates. On top of wage rate inflation, we expect to continue hiring at a healthy pace next year to support 2023 capacity and scale for 2024 growth. Our productivity has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, which has required additional hiring to support the operation. It seems that most industries and companies, including our peers, are experiencing a similar workforce dynamic. Based on our assumption that fleet utilization will be limited by pilot staffing constraints for the majority of 2023, these cost headwinds will persist throughout next year, but should improve somewhat in second half relative to first half 2023. We haven't finalized our second half 2023 capacity plans, but our current summation is that second half 2023 CASM-X will decrease in the low to mid-single-digit range compared with second half 2022. We continue to be focused on better optimization of staffing levels to our flight activity and improving our efficiency metrics and operating leverage. That work will begin in 2023 and continue into 2024. Turning to our fleet. Our planning assumption for Boeing aircraft deliveries this year remains unchanged from what we shared in July. While our contractual order book still reflects 114 aircraft in 2022, we continue to expect 66 -8 MAX deliveries this year due to supply chain challenges that Boeing is dealing with as well as uncertainty regarding the timing of the -7 MAX certification. However, we are encouraged to have received all 23 -8 MAX aircraft in the third quarter as expected and continue to expect 31 -8 MAX aircraft deliveries here in the fourth quarter. We do not expect to take delivery of any -7 MAX aircraft this year. We continue ongoing discussions with Boeing and just recently made some modifications to our order book. In short, we converted more -7 MAX aircraft to -8 MAX aircraft in the near term. We outlined the specific changes in our press release this morning, so I won't reiterate all the fleet out here. In terms of retirements, we now plan to retire a total of 26 -700 aircraft this year, a few less than previously expected, ending the year with an estimated 768 aircraft in our fleet. And our full year 2022 capex guidance remains unchanged at approximately $4 billion. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $13.7 billion after paying $1.9 billion to retire debt and finance lease obligations during third quarter. This included the full $1.2 billion outstanding amount of our 4.75% notes due 2023 and $184 million in principal of our convertible notes. We have now repurchased a total of $689 million of our convertible notes, roughly 30% of the original issuance, and have $1.6 billion currently outstanding. We remain in a net cash position with leverage at a very manageable 48%. We continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies, which remains one of our key long-term competitive advantages in good times and in challenging times. With our strong balance sheet and continued financial strength, we will soon discuss our 2023 capital plans with our board of directors, but our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We have a long-standing dividend history, and reinstating a dividend remains a high priority. We will also continue to look for opportunities to reduce debt. We will continue investing in the company and our people, and we are focused on wrapping up negotiations with all of our open contract labor groups. Last but not least, and at the right time, we intend to resume share repurchases as part of our shareholder return equation as we have in the past. And all of these intentions assume that the travel demand environment remains steady and we continue producing consistent quarterly profits. We are mindful of the economy and recessionary risk, and we would like to monitor the environment to see if there is any noticeable impact on travel demand as we move into 2023. Again, we are not seeing any noticeable impact today, but we would like to preserve a higher-than-normal cash balance for some period of time into next year before we materially reduce our cash reserves. So while I can't commit to anything today, I hope that gives you an idea of how we are evaluating our capital allocation choices. In closing, third quarter represented another profitable quarter in our recovery. Our momentum is building here in fourth quarter, supported by a strong revenue outlook, and I am encouraged with the progress we have made as we look to close the year strong and turn our focus to 2023. We are committed to generating healthy returns on invested capital, and I am very pleased with the direction we are headed. With that, I will turn it over to Andrew.

Southwest Airlines (LUV) Q2 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 28, 2022","Well, thank you, Ryan, and I appreciate everybody joining us this morning. Well, what a difference a quarter can make. Coming off first quarter's net loss, you will recall that we are encouraged by the positive trend change in travel demand in March, and we're optimistic about summer travel revenues. That said, I don't think any of us expected demand to surge to the levels we experienced in the second quarter, particularly in June. Andrew will cover the revenue details, but Q2 operating revenues increased 13.9% versus Q2 2019 to an all-time quarterly record of $6.7 billion despite Q2 managed business revenue still down 24% and capacity that was still down about 7%. We also produced an all-time record quarterly net income, excluding special items, of $825 million. It is all because of the people at Southwest Airlines, and I want to just say a huge thank you to them for a job very well done. I want to congratulate them on the progress that we've made together. It's just an incredible turnaround from last year, not to mention just a quarter ago. Looking forward, demand continues to be strong. We continue to experience both inflationary pressures and headwinds from lower productivity and efficiency. Energy prices have moderated a bit recently, but remain high, and we expect to have another meaningful fuel hedging gain here in Q3. But most importantly, we remain largely on our plan for this year. Our 2022 capacity remains stable. We remain on our cost plan. We're slightly ahead of our overall staffing plan and our operational reliability is much improved. We've made tremendous progress, and our people have a lot to be proud of. I'm just extremely thankful for all of their efforts in getting us to this point in the pandemic recovery. Our third quarter guidance is based on our current outlook and excludes any significant unforeseen events, but I'll admit that there's a lot of noise out there right now. It seems that all of us know someone who has this latest strand of COVID, inflation pressures are real, and they are worried about a potential recession. Consumer and business sentiment is down, and there are data points out there that could indicate early signs of a slowdown. But so far, demand remains strong, and we haven't seen material impacts to our business. As always, we'll continue to monitor the environment and be ready to respond if needed. It's helpful to remember that we have historically lagged in terms of impact to revenues going into a recession, and we have typically lagged recovery coming out. Well, you've heard me mention our list of key priorities for 2022 many times, I'd like to share our midyear progress on each of them. First, getting properly staffed at focusing on our people. I'm really proud to report that we reached pre-pandemic staffing levels in May 2022, which is just a huge milestone. We continue hiring in specific areas, particularly for pilots, and we expect to add over 10,000 employees this year out of attrition. We're pleased to be seeing the impact of our hiring in airports, especially given the busy travel season that we're in. Now that thousands of new employees have been due training and are contributing on the front line. Second, making progress toward our historic operational reliability and efficiency. Our operational performance since April has been very strong, and our flight cancellations in May and June were less than 1%, which means a 99-plus percent completion factor. Mike will cover the operations in more detail, but we are benefiting from getting better staffed, getting new employees through training and on the front line, adding more short-haul flying to provide better network stability and adding more flying between crew bases. We know that we've got work to do on the efficiency side as we focus on 2023, and we're laser-focused on walking down fleet and capacity plans, moderating our overall hiring, optimizing staffing to flight schedules, ringing out cost inefficiencies and returning to our historic efficiency levels by the end of next year. But again, I just want to thank our amazing people for their hard work as we continue to improve our operational reliability. And I want to thank our partners at the FAA and in the administration for working to overcome challenges and continuing to improve the airspace as travel demand returns. Third, providing legendary hospitality. I'm very proud of our people and our employees for restoring our customer service advantage this year. For January through May, we are No. 1 in customer service for the DOT's ranking for marketing carriers. I continue to be out in the field on a regular basis, and I get to experience firsthand our terrific employees taking great care of our customers. I get the emails, I see the stories, and I truly appreciate what they all do each and every day for our customers and for each other. I'm also very pleased to announce that we continue to make traveling on Southwest Airlines even easier by adding yet another customer benefit, our new flight credits don't expire policy. It's an industry-leading flight credit policy. And when you combine that with no change fees, no bag fees, Rapid Rewards points that don't expire and transferable flight credits, it's just a powerful low-fare brand combo that's all about winning more customers. While there is a cost, it's really the one-time cost of extending the COVID-related funds that would have expired this September and we expect the impact to be immaterial beyond this quarter. And finally, returning to consistent profitability. We just reported record earnings for Q2 and this is the most stable revenue environment that we've had in over two years. We remain well protected with our fuel hedge, and we are currently expecting to be profitable for Q3 and Q4 and for the full year 2022. Our main gating factor to future growth is pilot hiring. Despite delays in aircraft deliveries, we feel good about our ability to fly our flight schedules as planned, which are currently published through March 8. Our current outlook for first quarter 2023 is for capacity to be up about 10% versus first quarter 2022. And if we find ourselves in a position to need to republish schedules or trim capacity, we can certainly do that, but I'm optimistic that we can continue to avoid that going forward. It is still very early for 2023. So we're just going to take it one quarter at a time beyond our currently published schedules, but we're turning our focus to 2023 planning and, in particular, regaining historic efficiency levels, and we'll share our 2023 outlook with you at investor day, which is currently planned for December 7. Last, I just want to stop and acknowledge the assailant incident event that we had at Love Field earlier this week. Luckily, all of our employees and customers are safe. And I just want to say a huge thank you to our employees for taking great care of our customers and each other. I want to thank law enforcement for their swift and professional action. Thank the TSA for managing the fault out. And just thank you to everybody involved for keeping this from being worse. I'm just very, very grateful for that. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. ","Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. First, I'd also like to thank our employees for their outstanding efforts this quarter, which resulted in solid operational and record financial performance. The demand surge, coupled with constrained capacity, resulted in a strong yield environment and record quarterly operating revenues of $6.7 billion. The record revenue performance drove record quarterly net income, excluding special items, of $825 million despite higher fuel and inflationary cost pressures. We have also posted a strong operating margin, excluding special items, of 17.4%, which exceeded second quarter 2019 levels. All around, this was an impressive quarter and an important milestone along our pandemic recovery. Andrew will speak to our revenue trends in a minute, including why we made the policy change regarding flight credits that don't expire, but I want to make a few comments regarding the timing of revenue recognition for breakage revenue for tickets expected to go unused. The pandemic caused an extremely high number of customer flight cancellations during 2020, and to a lesser degree, last year and even the beginning of this year with Omicron wave. As a result, we have had more flight credits outstanding than normal. Today's policy change to eliminate the expiration dates for unused funds will result in lower breakage revenue for third quarter than we would record under our previous policy in large part due to the COVID-related travel funds that were set to expire in September. Andrew will cover the sequential impact to revenue in a minute, but we expect the policy change to result in significantly lower breakage revenue in third quarter, which we factored into our third quarter revenue guidance. We currently expect that impact to be in the $250 million to $300 million range. As we look beyond third quarter, we expect breakage as a percentage of revenue to normalize back to pre-pandemic levels and any ongoing impact from this policy change is estimated to be immaterial beyond this quarter. Our people did a great job, managing costs in second quarter and our fuel hedge performed very well. While market prices have moderated a bit lately, they are still elevated and volatile given the current geopolitical climate, regardless of the continued uncertainty surrounding the market our fuel hedge significantly offset the market price increase in jet fuel in second quarter 2022, saving us $330 million in fuel expense. We are 59% hedged for third quarter and estimate our third quarter fuel price to be in the $3.25 to $3.35 per gallon range, slightly below our second quarter fuel price. That includes an estimated $0.46 of hedging gains, which represents cost savings of more than $230 million in third quarter alone. Of course, this is a snapshot of our fuel guidance at a point in time and market oil prices and jet fuel cracks can move materially on a daily basis. We continue to seek opportunities to expand our 2023 and 2024 portfolio. The fair market value of our fuel hedge for the second half of this year is approximately $430 million, which would bring our full year 2022 fuel hedge benefit to roughly $1 billion based on price assumptions outlined in our earnings release, and the fair market value of our fuel hedge in 2023 and beyond is estimated at roughly $580 million. Taking a look at nonfuel costs, second quarter CASM-X was favorable to our previous guidance range at up 13.1% compared with second quarter 2019 and due to lower-than-anticipated benefit cost and the shifting of some maintenance costs into the second half of this year. For our third quarter, we currently estimate nonfuel CASM-X to increase in the range of 12% to 15% when compared with 2019 levels. More than half of that increase continues to be driven by inflationary pressures, primarily in higher rates for our labor benefits and airports. The remainder of the CASM-X increase is attributable to headwinds from operating at suboptimal productivity levels as we continue to work to get adequately staffed and our new employees trained while third quarter capacity levels are expected to be roughly in line with 2019 levels. Overall, I am pleased that we remain on track with our 2022 cost plan, especially in this environment, and our full year CASM-X guidance remains unchanged at 12% to 16% compared with 2019. As a reminder, this includes labor accruals for all work groups beginning April 1, taking into account our best estimate in this labor environment. Turning to our fleet. We have revised our expectations for aircraft deliveries this year due to supply chain challenges that Boeing is dealing with as well as the current status of the 7 MAX certification. Through the first half of this year, we took delivery of 12 8 MAX aircraft, and we now expect to take delivery of 23 aircraft in the third quarter and 31 aircraft in fourth quarter. All 8 MAX aircraft for a total of 66 deliveries this year. We do not expect to take delivery of any 7 MAX aircraft this year. We plan to retire a total of 29 700 aircraft this year and currently estimate will end the year with 765 aircraft in our fleet which supports our currently published flight schedules through March of next year. We have additional information in our press release, so I won't reiterate all the fleet details. You will see that our contractual order book still reflects 114 MAX deliveries, including options this year, but we are providing you our best estimate for what we think we will receive this year based on recent discussions with Boeing. We will continue working with Boeing with the focus on this year and next. Based on our updated planning assumption that we will receive a total of 66 8 MAX aircraft this year, we have lowered our 2022 capex guidance to approximately $4 billion billion lower than our previous guidance that assumed the delivery of 114 MAX aircraft. On our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $16.4 billion. We also recently extended our $1 billion revolving line of credit by two years with no change to our covenants, and it remains undrawn and fully available to us. We are in a net cash position and leverage is at a very manageable 53%. We continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies, which remains one of our key competitive advantages. We have modest scheduled debt payments for the remainder of this year. However, we have been opportunistic and have repurchased some of our convertible notes, $302 million so far this year and $505 million in total with $1.8 billion still outstanding. As a reminder, the payroll support restrictions on dividends and share repurchases remain in place until the end of this quarter. As always, we will be evaluating our capital plans with our board as we began planning for 2023. Throughout the pandemic, we've been surgical in our capital allocation decisions to drive future growth and value. And in terms of priority, as we move forward, we intend to continue investing in the business as we scale for future growth. We will continue paying down debt, and we will continue to be opportunistic where we can and we may have opportunities to reduce our leverage at a faster pace. As ever, we are committed to generating returns on capital, well in excess of our cost of capital and intend to outline our future capital plans at our investor day later this year. So more to come on that. In closing, I am very pleased with our second quarter results. As Bob mentioned, we remain on track with our plans this year, have better stability and have good momentum heading into the second half of this year. With that, I will turn it over to Andrew.

Southwest Airlines (LUV) Q1 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 28, 2022","All right. Well, thank you, Ryan. Hello, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. Well, the first quarter was a tale of two really different environments. As expected, we incurred losses in January and February due to the negative impacts of the Omicron variant. We anticipated travel demand would rebound in March, and we were pleasantly surprised at how quickly it bounced back and the extent to which demand and bookings surged. While we reported a Q1 loss, we were solidly profitable in March, actually not too far off of March 2019's profit. And while modest, I'm very pleased that first quarter unit revenues increased as compared to 2019. That was the first quarterly increase since the onset of the pandemic. So -- but for the Omicron impact, we estimate that we would have been profitable for the first quarter. In the first quarter, total operating revenues were 91% restored to 2019 levels despite Q1 managed business revenues being only 45% restored. Looking forward, we are very encouraged with the bookings and revenue trends we are experiencing for Q2, which indicate operating revenues will be fully restored to quarterly record levels on stronger leisure and business demand. Our revenue initiatives continue to roll out, and Andrew will cover our new fare product in more detail, and we look forward to launching that this quarter and getting another one of our revenue initiatives in place and producing value. We will have another meaningful fuel hedge gain in Q2, and we remain well protected with our fuel hedge portfolio in the second half of this year. Despite higher-than-normal unit cost inflation and productivity drags from underutilizing our assets, we expect to be solidly profitable for Q2 through Q4 and for the full year 2022. We are currently forecasting a healthy profit for Q2 with solid operating margins. Now of course, this is based on our current outlook and barring any unforeseen material events such as another wave that would impact or temporarily slow our progress, but we see no signs of that at this point. It just goes to show the power of our business model and how well our people are managing through a very difficult environment. Our March results and our current outlook for Q2 represent tremendous progress in our recovery. Even if we aren't fully expected to be optimized with our network fully restored until the end of next year, I'm just really, really proud of our people for their progress today. We've come a long way. I'm just very thankful for their constant resilience. Now key to our recovery is our continued hiring progress, and we now plan to hire and add over 10,000 new employees to the Southwest family this year, and that's net of expected attrition. By the end of this month, we will have welcomed roughly 6,500 new employees in 2022, and that's 5,000 net of attrition. And I'm just really pleased with our hiring progress. We continue to work through lower available staffing and training constraints to keep pace with rebounding travel demand, and we recently reduced our summer flight schedules to match our capacity guidance as we prioritize our operational reliability. I believe we have already accounted for the impact of staffing constraints in our full year 2022 guidance on capacity of down 4% versus 2019. But of course, we need to trim more capacity we certainly can, but I'm cautiously optimistic that we can get to a good balance of headcount to operate our planned flight schedules for the remainder of the year while setting ourselves up for resuming more material growth in 2023. You've heard me mention these things before, but we remain focused on a few key priorities for this year: first, getting properly staffed and focusing on our people; second, making progress toward our historic operational reliability and efficiency; third, providing our legendary hospitality; and fourth, returning to consistent profitability. It will take all 59,000 employees working together to execute on these focus areas and deliver a low-cost, high-quality product with low fares and great customer service. That's what our people are good at, and they've been good at that for 50 years, and they just do an incredible job. It's a tough environment, and they've been through a lot. I'm so grateful for them and what they do each and every day. Together, we're making tremendous progress to put this pandemic behind us. And while coming out of the pandemic has proven to be messy. As it was coming into the pandemic, I can assure you that we are very hard at work here at Southwest Airlines to make this company even stronger, and I remain very optimistic about our future. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. ","Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. First, I'd also like to thank our employees for their resilience in yet another challenging quarter impacted by the pandemic and weather disruptions. The rapid rise of the Omicron variant significantly impacted our business in January and February, resulting in a first quarter net loss of $191 million, excluding special items. March, however, was a much different story as we experienced a rebound in demand and surge in bookings during the month, driving March operating revenues higher in March 2019. This was our first monthly revenue increase relative to respective 2019 levels since the pandemic began. Last month, cash sales also represented a monthly record as bookings surged for spring and summer travel. And we posted healthy double-digit margins for the month of March despite the significant rise in market jet fuel prices. Needless to say, I am excited about the strong revenue trends in second quarter, as Andrew will cover in more detail in a minute. Taking a look at nonfuel cost, we are tracking in line with our 2022 cost plan with first quarter CASM-X coming in at the favorable end of our previous guidance range at up 17.9% compared with first quarter 2019. Thankfully, favorable airport settlements, better operational performance in March and lower-than-expected incentive pay created some end period cost relief in first quarter relative to our guidance. As we look ahead, we continue to experience unit cost pressure from operating at suboptimal productivity levels, as well as higher inflationary cost pressures, primarily in salaries, wages and benefits. We are leaving our full year CASM-X guidance unchanged at up 12% to 16% versus 2019 as we are still not able to fully utilize our assets or achieve optimal productivity levels due primarily to staffing challenges. That said, we do expect second half 2022 CASM-X growth rate relative to 2019 to ease sequentially from first half 2022. For our second quarter, we currently estimate CASM-X to increase in the range of 14% to 18% when compared with 2019 levels. Roughly half of that increase is a result of continued inflationary pressures in both labor and airport rates, which now includes labor rate increases across all work groups as best as we can estimate at this point given the current labor market and our current outlook for profitability this year. We estimate the incremental labor accruals to be roughly one point to CASM-X. The remaining half of the CASM-X increase is attributable to headwinds from operating at suboptimal capacity and productivity levels. Our outlook for second quarter capacity remains down approximately 7% from 2019 levels. And while our moderated capacity plans are designed to provide operational relief given our current available staffing challenges, it continues to create unit cost headwinds, particularly with a shorter stage length as we add back higher-frequency business routes, which Andrew will speak to shortly. Turning to fuel. Market prices have been on a rise and highly volatile given the current geopolitical climate. Our fuel hedge is providing excellent protection against rising energy prices and significantly offsets the market price increase in jet fuel in first quarter 2022. We are at 63% hedged for second quarter and estimate our second quarter fuel price to be in the $3.05 to $3.15 per gallon range, which is roughly $0.80 higher than our first quarter fuel price. That includes an estimated $0.61 of hedging gain, which represents cost savings of more than $290 million in second quarter alone. Of course, this is a snapshot of our fuel guidance at a point in time and market oil prices and heating cracks have been moving pretty materially on a daily basis. By the way, the current energy environment is exactly why we hedge fuel. Even though the hedging gains in the second quarter won't fully offset the rise in market fuel costs, our hedging portfolio is providing meaningful cost mitigation. The fair market value of our fuel hedge in 2022 is estimated at roughly $1 billion. Turning to our fleet. We recently adjusted our order book with Boeing to replace the majority of our -7 MAX firm orders with -8 MAX firm orders in the short term, along with other adjustments, which we outlined in our earnings release this morning. I won't reiterate all the details, but will note a few key highlights. Our current order book now reflects 21 -7 firm orders, 81 -8 firm orders and 12 remaining MAX options in 2022. If you recall from our previous order book as of the end of last year, we had no -8 firm orders in 2022. While we are eager to bring the -7 aircraft into our fleet and remain confident in the aircraft, we simply wanted to go ahead and rebound our 2022 order book to provide more near-term certainty given the ongoing certification process for the -7. We are grateful for the flexibility we have in our order book to shift between -7 and -8 and our plans this year to take 114 aircraft delivery and retire 28 -700 remain unchanged. While our capex guidance assumes we will exercise the remaining 12 options this year, we maintain flexibility to evaluate that intention as decision points arise each month. And given that the certification for the -7 has been going on for some time, we contemplated the possibility of taking some -8s this year into our 2022 capex estimate. Therefore, our capex guidance of approximately $5 billion remains unchanged. As I have mentioned before, we don't expect to incur a CASM-X penalty from holding on to extra aircraft versus accelerating -700 retirement while our capacity remains temporarily moderated. So from an economic standpoint, we may not decide to accelerate further aircraft retirements this year despite having more aircraft in our fleet than needed for current 2022 capacity plans. We are also mindful of aircraft and growth needs for 2023 as we plan to continue restoring the network. On our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $15.7 billion. Our leverage is at a very manageable 56%, and we continue to pay down and retire debt as opportunities arise as we have done with a portion of our convertible debt. We continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies, which remains one of our key competitive advantages. In closing, our second quarter financial trends are strong. Barring any unforeseen events or trend changes, we expect solid second quarter profit and operating margins. Our financial position and ample liquidity allows us to continue investing for the future so that we are ready to resume growth as soon as we are first able to restore our network and get staffing to desired levels. And we intend to grow. We are a growth airline. We have great momentum, and we are excited about the ample opportunities in front of us. With that, I will turn it over to Andrew.

Southwest Airlines (LUV) Q4 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 27, 2022","Thank you, Ryan. And good morning, everybody. And thank you for joining us for the Southwest Airlines fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. And first and foremost, I'm delighted to be able to say there were earnings and better than we thought at Investor Day last month. It's obviously a great way to end a tough, but much improved year, a great way to start a new year. We're, of course, finding our way through the Omicron surge in January, February, and looking forward to a strong rebound in March and thereafter. And, as always, as barring any unforeseen events, I expect we'll make great progress in 2022 and will enjoy another much improved year. As we all know too well, it will not be without its challenges. But, our people and our leadership are more than up to the task. I'm enormously proud of all of them. And I thank them profusely for their resilience and their perseverance through these myriad of challenges that we've faced the last two years. They've just done a phenomenal job. Southwest is on top, because our people deliver great service, low fares and our business model delivers consistent profits and handsome returns on capital. And we've emerged from two years of pandemic with our balance sheet strength and our liquidity intact. And we are perfectly positioned to restore, to expand, and compete aggressively in the coming years. And I could not be more enthused and more excited about our future. So, with that, I'm going to turn it over to our outstanding CEO and waiting for five more days, Mr. Bob Jordan. ","Right. Hello, everyone, and thank you, Bob. I've worked with Bob for a long time, and I agree with Gary. He is going to be a great CEO. And my friend, Gary Kelly, you are amazing, and I just want to thank you for all that you've done for our company and for all of us and for all of our shareholders. And I'm not going to say anything else because I will get choked up. So, instead, I'm going to provide a quick overview of our financial results and share some additional color on our outlook beyond what we provided in our press release to you all this morning. And I also just want to thank our employees for their incredible resilience as we manage through this dynamic environment. It is their hard work, dedication, and focus that enabled us to achieve an important milestone in our recovery with our first quarterly profit since the pandemic began. We reported a $68 million profit in fourth quarter or $0.11 per diluted share. And excluding special items, we reported an $85 million profit or $0.14 per diluted share. As Bob mentioned, our fourth quarter profit was driven by strong leisure demand during the holidays, business travel momentum, and incremental revenue from our new co-brand credit card agreement with Chase. Our fourth quarter results were all within the guidance ranges provided last month at Investor Day. For full year 2021, our net income was 977 million or $1.61 per diluted share, driven by 2.7 billion of payroll support program proceeds. Excluding this temporary benefit to salary, wages, and benefits expense, and other smaller special items, our full year net loss was 1.3 billion or a $2.15 loss per diluted share. Andrew will cover our revenue trends and outlook here in a minute. Taking a look at cost. We continue to experience inflationary cost pressure experienced in fourth quarter, primarily in salary, wages and benefits and airport costs as expected. A portion relates to hiring, and we made great strides toward our hiring efforts in 2021 and remain on track with plans this year. And, of course, the labor market continues to be a challenge, which continues to pressure wage rates across the board. Since Investor Day, we have experienced additional cost pressures related to omicron and winter weather. As a result, our first quarter unit cost inflation compared with first quarter 2019 and excluding fuel special items and profit sharing has increased about 10 points. Roughly half of that increase is driven by the 150 million of additional incentive pay we are offering to operations employees to early February, and the other half is associated with flying fewer ASMs than we were planning. In light of the significant impact from the omicron wave on available staffing, extending the temporary incentive pay and further reducing our capacity were necessary steps to stabilize the operation. Aside from these impacts, we would be on track with our previous unit cost outlook. Market fuel prices have continued to rise here, which also resulted in a $0.10 increase in our fuel cost per gallon guidance. Our estimated first quarter fuel price in the $2.25 to $2.35 per gallon range is also roughly $0.25 higher than our first quarter 2019 fuel price, and that's inclusive of an estimated $0.35 of hedging gains here in the first quarter. Turning to our full year guidance. At Investor Day, we were planning for capacity to be roughly flat versus 2019 levels with no material impact from the omicron variant on either revenues or costs at that time. Fast forward to today, the impact from the omicron variant on available staffing has led us to reevaluate our first half 2022 capacity plans, in particular March through May. Our planned flight schedule adjustments take some capacity upside optimism off the table for this year and reduces our full year 2022 capacity outlook by about four points from roughly flat to down 4% versus 2019. I've already covered the 150 million of additional incentive pay in first quarter. And in order to be more competitive on the hiring front, in particular for ground operations, we are raising starting wage rates from $15 per hour to $17 per hour, which is estimated to be a 20 to $25 million total impact to this year. And of course, we have contemplated labor rate inflation in our guidance as best we can for this year, understanding that the market is somewhat uncertain. This is clearly not where we hope to be along our recovery curve nearly two years into this pandemic, but we are making great progress. While we must remain nimble in this environment, it takes the necessary actions to take care of our employees and provide a reliable product for our customers. We are very focused on the long term and determined to get back to 2018 levels of productivity and efficiencies as we shared with you all at Investor Day. As Bob said, our goal is to get there by the end of next year. Although it is early based on our current plan for 2022 and preliminary plan for 2023, we expect 2023 CASM-X will decline year over year compared with 2022. Longer term, our framework that we provided at Investor Day remains unchanged, and that includes a post-pandemic target of mid-single-digit ASM growth accompanied by low single-digit CASM-X growth. I want to be clear that our longer-term CASM-X framework includes an estimate for labor rate increases as best we can estimate today. Turning to fleet. We currently have 77 MAX firm orders and 37 MAX options with Boeing this year. While our plan assumes we will exercise the remaining 37 options this year, we maintain the flexibility to evaluate that intention as decision points arise. We continue to believe that taking the additional options this year will yield a positive NPV on aircraft replacement if we don't deploy them in the network. As I have mentioned to you all before, we won't incur a material CASM-X penalty from holding on to extra aircraft in the event we temporarily park some of our -700 while capacity is moderated this year. As we work our way back to an efficient utilization of the fleet, we remain in the fortunate position to have the flexibility needed with our retirement plans without a financial penalty. I'll wrap up with a quick note on our balance sheet strength. We ended 2021 with liquidity of 16.5 billion, our leverage is at a very manageable 54%, and we continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies, which I believe is one of our key competitive advantages. We have ample liquidity that allows us for a further cushion in the event of further COVID wave. Overall, our balance sheet strength puts us in a category of one in terms of our ability to withstand shocks and remain financially healthy. With that, I will turn it over to Andrew.

Southwest Airlines (LUV) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 21, 2021","Ryan, thank you very much, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to our third-quarter 2021 earnings call. After five quarters of pandemic weakness, we saw a dramatic recovery in terms of passengers, fares, and revenues. And obviously, that was very encouraging. It would have been even better, but for the Delta variant surge, which began to affect us in early August. Of course, the bounce in revenues came with a lot of bumps in the operation, though, as our historic staffing models left us short and caused us to miss our reliability plan for the quarter. And that required immediate attention and action for future schedules, which we have taken. So I would be the first to admit that things are messy. It is also very encouraging to see the earnings potential and especially considering that business travel is far from recovered to 2019 levels, and our capacity is not fully restored with 24 airplanes still sitting on the ground. It also illustrates that this virus and its effect on our business can be unpredictable and volatile. And the burden to manage through all of this falls to our people, and we've gone from not enough to do to too much to do in a very short period of time. And as a perspective, of course, I think we'd all take the latter scenario any day. It has been a huge challenge for our people, so I want to thank them. They are warriors. They have performed exceptionally well and especially considering the challenging circumstances. I am very proud of them and they remain and always will be my top priority. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our incoming CEO, Mr. Bob Jordan, who will give us a quick overview. ","Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. I'll provide a quick overview of our overall financial results and some color on our outlook. On a GAAP basis, we generated a $446 million profit in third quarter or $0.73 per diluted share. And this was driven by the $763 million of PSP proceeds that offset a sizable portion of salary wages and benefits expenses. Excluding this temporary PSP benefit and other smaller special items, our net loss was $135 million or a $0.23 loss per diluted share. Our third-quarter results are clearly not where we need them to be, and we are disappointed by the step back in revenue trends as a result of the Delta variant. Even so, we are pleased our bottom line came in above expectations and improved sequentially from second quarter. And we currently have $16.2 billion of cash and short-term investments on our balance sheet. This is well in excess of our outstanding debt, and it is relatively in line with where we were at the time of July earnings before the impact of the Delta variant began. Overall, travel demand has proven to be more resilient today, and the overall impact of this variant has been much less than what we previously experienced since the pandemic began. Before I get into the specifics, I want to offer my thanks and appreciation to our employees. Their warrior spirits have been in full effect since the pandemic began, and I commend them for continuing to work together to combat this pandemic. I am also pleased for them that we were able to accrue additional profit sharing in third quarter as a result of our GAAP profit. Third-quarter available seat miles and nonfuel unit costs were within our guidance ranges, and I am pleased with our overall cost control throughout the quarter. Operating revenues were better than guidance, and that was primarily due to improving revenue and booking trends in the second half of September, soon after our last investor update as COVID-19 cases began to decline. And fuel cost per gallon was slightly better than guidance. We provided a lot of color for you in our press release regarding revenue and cost trends, as well as fleet plans, so I will just add a few additional thoughts. We had 4 points of notable cost pressure in the third quarter, and these 4 points were primarily due to premium pay, as well as other ramp-up costs. In terms of premium pay going forward, we currently anticipate that we will need less in fourth quarter as we have reduced our flight schedules to provide more staffing cushion. The reduction in premium pay provides a roughly 2-point unit cost tailwind from third to fourth quarter. Our two largest ongoing inflationary cost categories are salary wages and benefits and airport costs. These two categories alone are driving 3 to 4 points of unit cost inflation in fourth quarter on a year-over-two-year basis. First, on salary wages and benefits, which represents roughly 3 points of the unit cost pressure, we have higher-than-normal wage rate inflation, including the recent increase in the minimum hourly wage. It is a tight labor market, which is also putting pressure on wages. In addition, we should have nearly everyone back from extended leave by year end, and we are hiring across all work groups to support the current operation. Second on airport costs. By year end, we will have 18 new airports in our network. So our overall properties footprint has increased and we are experiencing rate pressure across the board. The rate increases we are anticipating continue to be much higher than inflation, especially in this environment. Our fourth-quarter trips are expected to be down 13% compared with fourth-quarter 2019, which underutilizes our space and exacerbates the inflation we're currently seeing. I expect better operating leverage from our airport facilities in the future as we are able to add depth and frequency back to our network over the next few years. Also in fourth quarter, we have 4 to 5 points of notable cost pressure above and beyond general inflation. These cost pressures are attributable to hiring, our vaccination incentive pay program, and lower productivity than historical norms. We expect cost pressures from lower productivity to persist in the near term and subside as we are able to restore the majority of the network. Even with these inflationary pressures, our fourth-quarter bottom-line outlook is trending better than third quarter, except for higher fuel prices. Fuel prices, even after factoring in higher hedging gains, are $0.26 higher in fourth quarter than in third quarter, which is roughly $120 million more in fuel expense sequentially. That said, our strong fuel hedge is currently expected to provide $0.18 of hedging gains here in fourth quarter. And underlying revenue trends have picked up, which is encouraging, even though we are expecting a loss for fourth quarter in this high fuel price environment. Our flight schedules are currently published through April 24. We have reduced our fourth-quarter capacity to down 8% on a year-over-year basis. And we currently expect our first-quarter 2022 capacity to be down 6% compared with first-quarter 2019. We currently have 72 firm orders and 42 options next year, and we will continue to evaluate option exercises as decision points arise. Regardless of our capacity plans next year, we continue to believe that taking the additional 2022 options will yield a positive net present value on aircraft replacement if we don't deploy them in the network. As far as other commentary on 2022, we will share more about our fleet and capacity plans and our financial outlook at investor day. And I'm looking forward to seeing you all there. So with that, I will turn it over to Andrew.  ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/22/southwest-airlines-luv-q3-2021-earnings-call-trans/
Southwest Airlines (LUV) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 22, 2021","Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everybody, and thank you all for joining us for our second-quarter earnings call. We're obviously very delighted at the turnaround in our business from the previous four quarters of billion-dollar losses, and our revenues nearly doubled in the second quarter from first-quarter levels, and that was on a capacity bump of 44%. Our revenues were much stronger than we had been forecasting just 90 days ago, and all of that, of course, flowed through to better margins and better cash. Yesterday's cash was over $17 billion, and that's plus $1 billion line of credit, well in excess of our $11.4 billion of debt. So while our bookings and revenue trends are even better than the month of June and certainly better than the second quarter as a whole, we're very well prepared to manage and muddle our way through if the Delta variant affects our business. And so far, we're not detecting any impact at all. Again, very strong bookings and revenue trends in the third quarter. So right now, I'm very pleased with all of that. Very pleased with our revenue, our July business, and the outlook for the rest of the quarter. This has been a long struggle to get to this point, of profitability in the month of June. The pandemic, of course, turned everybody's world upside down and it's still not completely right side up. But I must thank our employees once again for their heroic and very hard work. Normal summer demand is always a challenge to manage, and it's, of course, even more so here in 2021, especially in June when we had technology issues and bad weather combined. It made it very difficult. Things are much better in July. It's not -- still not where I want us to be but we'll continue to improve, and I'm very confident that we'll adjust as necessary and if necessary. So our immediate focus is on running a very high-quality, on-time airline and then gradually restoring our traditional efficiencies that are attendant with our low-fare, point-to-point, high-utilization business model. And given the revenue recovery, obviously, our next focus is to sustain our profitability that we have achieved here in June and maintain stability going forward. Next year, we plan to resume new aircraft deliveries, with the desire to restore our route network as needed to pre-pandemic levels. And clearly, the network restoration will depend upon travel demand, which may, in turn, depend upon the state of the pandemic. So worst case, we'll reduce our growth and early retire our oldest aircraft, which will be accretive to earnings with the trade-out with the MAX. So we're very well-positioned and very well prepared to manage pretty much any scenario here in the next couple of years. So things aren't back to normal yet, but clearly, they have stabilized and are much improved, and we're at a point now where we can actually plan and work on managing and spend less time on surviving the intensive care unit. And then finally, I did want to congratulate and welcome Bob Jordan, He'll be our next CEO come February 1 of next year, and the reception so far has been terrific. The transition work is well underway. Bob is very busy and he may comment on that, but it's going very, very well. Very proud of Bob. He's going to do a terrific job. And I'm going to hang around to support our team in any way that I can. So with that, Bob, let me just turn it over to you. ","Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. I will provide a quick overview of our overall financial results and some color on our outlook. On a GAAP basis, we generated a $348 million profit in second quarter or $0.57 per diluted share. In addition to improving revenue trends, the primary driver of our GAAP profit for the quarter was the $724 million of PSP proceeds that offset a sizable portion of salaries, wages, and benefits expenses. Excluding this temporary PSP benefit and our usual hedge-related special items, our non-GAAP net loss was $206 million or a $0.35 loss per diluted share. Second-quarter operating revenues, nonfuel operating costs, fuel costs, and available seat miles were all within our most recent guidance ranges. And I am pleased with our overall financial performance in second quarter. With the strong pent-up summer demand and a solid cost performance, June marked a key milestone as we generated both average daily core cash flow and profits as we had hoped. This is our first monthly profit since February 2020 when soon after the negative financial impact of the pandemic began to impact our results. And this is excluding the benefits of PSP proceeds, which is more reflective of our base business. These second-quarter results, though not where we need to be, represent a significant recovery for our business and are a testament to our amazing employees who are simply the best in the industry and make us proud each and every day. And by all indications, it appears that we outperformed the industry again in second quarter. We provided a lot of color in our press release regarding revenue and cost trends. I will just add that our trips flown are estimated to be down 11% in third quarter compared to third-quarter 2019. And as such, we have several cost categories that are expected to continue to trend lower than 2019 levels, such as maintenance expense, advertising expense, technology expenses, and passenger and personnel-related expenses. These cost categories are expected to ramp up as trips and passengers increase and as we resume a more normal investment agenda moving forward. We are mindful of the tight job market, as well as general inflationary pressures. We expect to have wage rate inflation beyond our normal annual wage rate increases as we want to be competitive to retain and attract talent, including the decision to increase the minimum hourly wage to $15 per hour across all work groups, we now estimate $5 million to $10 million of additional salary, wages and benefits cost pressure in third quarter and approximately $15 million in fourth quarter. We are also mindful of bottlenecks, shortages, and ramp-up inconsistencies across the travel industry as we restart after more than a year of little activity, and we are not immune. That said, we will continue our focus on ramping up costs, along with wide activity, as efficiently as possible while being nimble to adjust and add where needed. We are hopeful to generate net income again in third and fourth quarter on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. And our ability to do so will largely be dependent on the revenue environment, which Tom will cover in a minute. But based on our current revenue outlook and even with the additional cost pressures we noted, our third-quarter bottom-line outlook is over $200 million better than it was back in April. We have flight schedules currently out through early January, and we will continue evaluating growth opportunities and fleet and capacity decisions to construct the most efficient route network for 2022, being mindful that our network has evolved from what it was pre-pandemic. With leisure travel levels where they are today, it is easy to forget that less than six months ago, the environment was drastically different. Over the past year, we were most focused on raising capital and building liquidity, minimizing significant cash burn, and drastically cutting capacity and costs. And the changes that we made to our network are producing the revenue we had hoped or even better than hoped, and we are now evolving our focus areas. First, we are focused on managing through the current environment with adequate resources to deliver a reliable operation. We then need to optimize our cost profile with our route network in 2022. And beyond that, we'll be focused on producing sustainable levels of profitabilities, margins, and returns. We plan to continue managing the business closer in, at least for the remainder of this year, but we have begun the 2022 planning process at a very high level. Although I don't have any specifics to share with you today, I can reaffirm that we have tremendous flexibility, perhaps the most flexibility we have ever had going into any year in my nearly 30 years at Southwest. We have flexibility with our cost-efficient Boeing order book with a significant number of MAX options remaining in 2022. We have flexibility in terms of where to deploy our aircraft in the network and how much capacity to fly in 2022. And we have a strong cash balance, modest debt requirement, and discretion over how quickly we want to resume non-aircraft investments in 2022. So we have flexibility with our capital. And aside from our people, our biggest core strength is our balance sheet and financial preparedness, even coming out of this pandemic. So with that, I will turn it over to Tom.

Southwest Airlines (LUV) Q1 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 22, 2021","Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to our first-quarter 2021 call. The first-quarter results are notable, first of all, because they're a lot better than what we thought they would be back in January. But even with that improvement, we still lost $1 billion and it was worse than our fourth-quarter results due to the weaker seasonality of January and February travel. And clearly, that's not sustainable. But fortunately, we're here to report that we believe the worst is now finally behind us. We have a much better outlook and report for second quarter, and we'll give you all a full brief on the first-quarter results and our second-quarter outlook. But here are a few topside highlights before I pass the call over to Mike. Number one, thankfully, we received a second round of payroll support or PSP from the Federal Government and -- effectively covering the first quarter. It was much needed. We're very grateful. We're the only airline who has avoided pay cuts, layoffs, furloughs and the like. And I'm very, very gratified that our 50-year record remains intact on that front. Not counting working capital changes in cash flow, our cash losses of $1.3 billion were more than offset by the PSP. Number two, beginning with a mid-March inflection point, we finally began to see bookings improve from the nine-month, down 65% flatline that we have been experiencing. So vaccines, vaccinations, case counts and spring break all converged in the right way. And sensing this, we boosted our capacity by 50% overnight or 1,000 daily departures in the middle of March. Number three, taking into account our voluntary separation program and attrition since June, our staffing currently is at 92% of our June 2019 levels. And in addition, we've had thousands of people on leave. And now that we're adding flights, we're smoothly recalling those that are needed on voluntary leaves and having avoided the mess associated with furloughs. And as a result, we plan to fly 96% of our June 2019 ASMs, albeit with a different route network. But the point being is that we're very well prepared to flex up our capacity. And even having said that, I think that we're very well aware that it will still be messy and we'll have to carefully manage. Number four, please understand that the path back to breakeven and beyond is dependent upon two things. Number one, we have to have sufficient flight and seat activity, and you need to read into that that means more than what we've been doing prior to March. And number two, we've got to have more customers to fill those flights and obviously, read into that revenue. So we have too much fixed costs for us to be profitable below roughly three to three, 3,000 to 3,300 flights a day. At least now it's realistic for us to project breakeven cash flow scenarios, which are possible here in the second quarter. So in summary, I'm -- a lot of things here this morning. I'm relieved. I'm optimistic. I'm enthused. I'm grateful and I'm especially thankful to our tens of thousands of employees who have fought their way through this pandemic and gotten us at least at this point. We've got a long way to go, but I'm very, very confident that we can all depend upon our Southwest warriors. They are very resilient. And then, finally, I'm pleased with the performances. The operation has been superb. The new cities are meeting or exceeding our expectations. I'm glad to have all of them as permanent additions to our route network. The addition of global distribution system capabilities could not have been a more timely add to our capabilities as we're pushing aggressively into the huge managed travel business market. And we've got a great domestic network. We've got great service. And finally, they're going to have access to low fares. The cost and the spending performance has also been excellent, and we're making great progress toward restoring our historic productivity and efficiency. And then, I'm absolutely delighted with the deal that we reached with Boeing last month that strategically secures our position as an all 737 operator, with all the attendant competitive benefits that that enables. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to our COO Mike Van de Ven, who I know will elaborate more on that, but among other things. Mike, great job, great performance. So take it away. ","All right. Thank you, Tom, and hello, everyone. I'll round out today's comments with a few remarks on our performance and an overview of our cost, fleet, liquidity and cash burn before we move on to Q&A. This morning, we reported first-quarter net income of $116 million or $0.19 per diluted share, which included $1.2 billion in payroll support. Excluding this benefit and other special items detailed in this morning's press release, our first-quarter net loss was $1 billion or a $1.72 loss per diluted share. While our losses persisted in first quarter, I feel good about the progress we are making, in particular, as we move through our second quarter here. I want to commend our people on another solid cost performance as we have to remain extra diligent with our spending. Excluding special items, our first-quarter total operating cost decreased 24% year over year to $3.3 billion and increased 17% year over year on a unit basis. Fuel represented about 35% of that decrease. Our first-quarter economic fuel price of $1.70 per gallon was at the midpoint of our guidance range, and our fuel expense declined 44% year over year. Reduced capacity levels resulted in gallon consumption down 37%, the largest driver of our year-over-year decline and economic price per gallon down 11%. We realized a modest hedging gain of approximately $1 million or $0.01 per gallon, and our hedging program premium costs were $25 million or $0.09 per gallon. While fuel price was still below year-ago levels, energy prices have been creeping up over the past few quarters, which only serves as a reminder of the importance of having a consistent and meaningful fuel hedging program. We have great hedging protection in place, with hedging gains beginning at Brent prices in the $65 to $70 per barrel range, and more material gains once you get to $80 per barrel and higher. Based on market prices as of April 15, we expect our second-quarter fuel price to be in the range of $1.85 to $1.95 per gallon, including another modest hedging gain of $0.01 per gallon. Looking at 2022, we also have a high-quality fuel place -- fuel hedge in place with a similar level of protection. But we would start recognizing hedging gains around the $60 per barrel Brent range with more meaningful hedging gains beginning at $70 per barrel and higher. Last year, we took the opportunity to add our 2022 hedge position while prices were lower. Our first-quarter fuel efficiency improved 5% year over year, primarily driven by many of our older aircraft remaining parked. Some of the current fuel efficiency gains are temporary as we'll see some sequential pressure as we return more of our older 737-700 aircraft to service this summer. However, we currently estimate our second-quarter fuel efficiency to be sequentially in line with first quarter's ASMs per gallon, partially due to returning the MAX to service last month. The MAX is our most fuel-efficient aircraft, and we have a line of sight to more significant improvements over many years as we plan to retire a significant amount of our 737-700 aircraft in the next 10 to 15 years. We get at least a 14% fuel efficiency improvement on a per-aircraft basis each time we replace an end-of-life 737-700 aircraft with a new MAX. This will be a big driver of progress toward our long-term environmental goals. Excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, first-quarter operating cost decreased 19% year over year on the better end of our guidance range. On a unit basis, the increase was 23% year over year, primarily driven by the 35% reduction in capacity. We continue to realize cost savings from our actions taken in response to the pandemic, including $412 million of savings and first-quarter salaries, wages and benefits driven by the benefits of our employee voluntary lead programs implemented last year. We had pay rate increases for our people that are flowing through this year, but the voluntary program savings far offset that rate inflation. Outside of salary wages and benefits, we had year-over-year decreases in most other categories due to reduced capacity and the related cost relief, primarily in the areas of maintenance, landing fees and employee customer and revenue-driven costs. In terms of a few other notable items in first quarter, aircraft rental expense was $52 million, down 9% year over year, driven by the return of leased 737-700 aircraft. Advertising spend has increased sequentially from fourth quarter as we ramp up the marketing, but our first-quarter advertising spend was down 8% year over year. And we realized onetime favorable settlements in first quarter, primarily property taxes, and those are reflected in our other operating expenses. Again, our first-quarter cost performance was solid, and I appreciate all the work our teams are doing to manage costs in this unprecedented environment. Turning to second quarter, we currently expect operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense, special items and profit sharing, to increase in the range of 10% to 15% year over year and also to increase sequentially compared with first quarter. We estimate that 60% to 70% of the expected sequential increase is due to variable flight driven expenses as we plan to increase capacity to near 2019 levels by June. To support the increased flight activity, we are recalling a portion of our employees who had elected our voluntary extended emergency time-off program. In terms of salaries, wages and benefits expense, sequential cost increases from a few items account for about a third of the total sequential increase. We have increases driven by a higher number of active employees in second quarter, including the impact of recalled employees. Roughly half of our recalled employees will return in second quarter and some training will be required for those employees that we recalled as we prepare for them to go back to work. Partially offsetting our second-quarter cost pressure from these three costs is an estimated $325 million in cost savings from our voluntary separation and extended leave programs for those employees that took a voluntary separation last year and those employees that remain on extended time off. With some early recalls, we now estimate annual 2021 cost savings from our employee voluntary program to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, down from our previous estimate of $1.2 billion. Outside of salary wages and benefits, the largest drivers of our sequential cost pressure are flight-driven cost increases and landing fees, employee, customer and revenue-related costs, and maintenance expense as we prepare aircraft that have been parked for a return to revenue service, as well as higher flight driven maintenance expenses as flights resume. These ramp-up costs combined represent the other two-thirds of our capacity-driven sequential cost increase. Outside of capacity-driven cost increases, we expect sequential cost pressure driven by airport cost inflation and higher aircraft ownership costs due to the MAX deliveries. And this rounds out the majority of the remaining cost increases. While we are facing expected sequential cost increases that naturally come with increased flight activity, we expect our second quarter operating cost to remain below second-quarter 2019 levels. And we expect that our ramp-up cost pressures will vary and persist until we get capacity back to 2019 levels. That said, we remain laser-focused on cost control as we navigate through this recovery. Our first-quarter interest expense was $114 million, in line with fourth quarter and assuming our current momentum continues, we don't currently anticipate raising additional debt. And based on current levels of debt outstanding and current interest rates, we expect second-quarter interest expense to be approximately $115 million. Our first-quarter effective tax rate was 21%, which was in line with our expectations. And we currently estimate our annual 2021 effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. Mike covered the highlights of our Boeing agreement. I just want to add my thanks to the teams at Southwest Boeing and GE and CFM International for their tireless work to develop agreements that extend and support our long-term relationships and that supports all our Boeing 737 -- our all-Boeing 737 business model. Based on the refreshed order book and our retirement plans over the next 10 to 15 years, I feel very comfortable with our ability to manage the size of our fleet, support fleet modernization and pursue growth opportunities as they arise. And we can do this in a cost-effective manner, in particular, with manageable capex. We ended first quarter with 730 aircraft, including 61 MAX 8s. For second quarter, we expect to receive seven MAX 8 deliveries and retire three 737-700s. And we will have one more MAX 8 delivery in third quarter and retire up to six more -700s by the end of the year. Beyond 2021, we are going to wait a bit longer before we make a decision about 2022 fleet plans and 2022 capex. That said, we are well-positioned to begin retiring roughly 30 to 35 737-700s a year, beginning next year. Our firm orders should cover the majority of our fleet modernization plans, and we will make decisions on exercising options based on the economic and demand environment and based on growth opportunities and capacity plans. As Mike mentioned, our options provide us tremendous flexibility. As expected, our first-quarter capital spending was $95 million, and we currently expect our full-year 2021 capital spending to be roughly $500 million, with an immaterial amount of aircraft capex and driven mostly by technology, facilities and operational investments. We have plenty of flexibility to manage capex with our order book with aircraft capex on firm orders of $700 million next year. Before I wrap up and open the call up for questions, I'll provide an overview of our liquidity and cash burn. We currently have approximately $14.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, in line with where we ended first quarter. We are thankful to our federal government for providing continued economic relief to protect jobs as the pandemic persists. We received $1.7 billion in payroll support program proceeds during first quarter and expect to receive an additional $259 million as our final distribution of the second round of PSP support or $2 billion total from the PSP extension. We are currently working to finalize our agreement with the treasury on the third round of PSP support and expect to receive an additional $1.9 billion. Our liquidity position provides a solid foundation as we operate in the wake of 2020 substantial losses and on the heels of another substantial non-GAAP loss in the first quarter. Our first-quarter average core cash burn was $13 million per day, a $1 million sequential increase from fourth quarter with rising fuel prices offsetting improving revenue trends. The material improvement in revenue began substantially in March, resulting in an $8 million improvement from our February cash burn of $17 million per day to a March cash burn of $9 million per day. When you include the benefits from future cash bookings and other changes in working capital, as we define for you in our earnings release, we flipped positive in March and produced cash flows of $4 million per day. Assuming the continuation of positive revenue trends, we expect our average core cash burn in second quarter to be in the range of $2 million to $4 million per day. And we continue to expect to achieve cash burn breakeven with roughly -- with revenue of roughly 60% to 70% of 2019 levels. Barring any unforeseen changes in current demand trends, our cost trends and assuming revenue and booking trends continue to build throughout second quarter, we are hopeful that we can achieve core cash breakeven results or better by June. In closing, while the effects of the pandemics persist, our Southwest team continues to conquer both the familiar and unfamiliar challenges of the day. While we aren't out of the woods yet, we are encouraged by the rise in vaccinations that seem to be unlocking the pent-up leisure demand that we all believed was there. We are optimistic and hopeful that the worst is behind us, but we are mindful that business travel continues to significantly lag leisure. We will continue to manage our business closer in to focus on what we can control, maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, reducing our cash burn as we work toward breakeven and managing tight cost control and seeking efficiencies, especially as we began to revamp capacity levels. I am immensely proud of how our people continue to persevere and show up for our company, our customers and each other. Working together, I am confident that our best is yet to come. With that, Keith, we are ready to take analyst questions. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/22/southwest-airlines-luv-q1-2021-earnings-call-trans/
Southwest Airlines (LUV) Q4 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 28, 2021","Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us for our fourth-quarter 2020 call. We closed out the year, as expected, with no surprises. And even Southwest is not immune to COVID-19, and we recognized our first annual loss since 1972. It was a big one and with non-GAAP losses coming in at $3.5 billion. But having said that, we were and remain very well prepared to weather this continuing storm and especially important is that we want to emerge on top in the airline industry. We have the strongest liquidity. We have $14.3 billion, including $13.3 billion in cash and equivalents, $12 billion in unencumbered assets, and that doesn't include our frequent flyer program. We have the strongest balance sheet, and pre-pandemic debt to total capital was a company record low at 24%. We have investment-grade credit ratings, and we have cash well in excess of our outstanding debt. Third, we have the best business model. We have an unprecedented run of 47 years of profitability, and that was built on low cost and low fares and coupled with great service. And that, in turn, has resulted in unprecedented job security, especially unprecedented for an airline going on 50 years without a furlough, without a pay cut and the only major airline to avoid all of that during this pandemic, and I'm very, very proud of that. We have the best operation. And as evidenced by the Wall Street Journal's annual ranking of airline performances, it was released this week, was Southwest as No. 1. And finally, we have the best customer service, and I base that on numerous brand surveys and my expectation that, once again, we will be at the top of the industry in terms of the United States DOT Customer Satisfaction Index of fewest customer complaints. Now, no one can deny that that is a powerhouse combination of attributes for any company. And it just reminded me, as I was recapping that, I was listening to Herb many years ago. He pointed out that most companies never achieve the best designation in a single category, much less five. And I mentioned these things really not to brag but just to put things in perspective, and that is to say that, yes, these are bad times. Yes, we had our first loss since our start-up year, but we have much to be grateful for. And we have every reason to be hopeful that this, too, shall pass. And when it does, we will be ready. And speaking of being ready, I mean a surge -- a resurgence in traffic and revenues. So we want to be ready for that. And we have to have that to achieve breakeven, and then beyond that, prosperity. So there's a balancing act here, and we're balancing a desire to conserve cash and minimize our losses, which requires that we operate at a reduced schedule as compared to the need and the ability to achieve breakeven by generating more traffic, and we can only do that by offering more flights. So getting that balance is key, and we're intensely focused on that. And I'll just add that we've got the talent, we've got the experience, and we have the tools that we need to execute and execute that well. Once we get past this January, February, winter doldrum, we'll see what happens, and we'll respond accordingly. So we've got excellent updates prepared this morning for you from Mike Van de Ven, our COO; Tom Nealon, our president; and Tammy Romo, our CFO. So I don't want to steal any of their thunder, except to say one more thing. I mentioned before that we have a lot to be grateful for, and we do, and especially at Southwest. And I mentioned gratitude last time in our third-quarter call, but I think it's important to repeat it again. I am especially grateful for our people, their resolve, their resilience, their civility, and their love. They've gotten us to this point. They will get us through this. They have performed superbly. And I know that everybody in this room with me could -- would join me and say how proud we are of them, and we all just want to thank them profusely. They are heroes. So some of these heroes are sitting here with me. And Mike, I want to congratulate you on a magnificent operational performance. So why don't you kick us off this morning, Mr. Mike Van de Ven, COO? ","All right. Thank you, Tom, and hello, everyone. I'll round out today's comments with an overview of our cost performance, fleet, liquidity, and cash burn before we open it up for Q&A. Before I start, I'd be remiss if I did not acknowledge our wonderful team of Southwest warriors for their incredible efforts over the past year as we all dealt with the unimaginable impacts of this pandemic. The effects of the pandemic resulted in our first annual loss since 1972, ending our streak of 47 consecutive years of profitability, a record unmatched in aviation history. Our 2020 net loss was $3.1 billion. Excluding special items, our annual net loss was $3.5 billion or a $6.22 loss per diluted share. The biggest drivers of 2020 special items were payroll support proceeds of $2.3 billion that were an offset to salary wages and benefits, which was offset by $1.4 billion in accruals for our voluntary separation and extended emergency time-off programs, as well as $222 million gain from sale-leaseback transactions. While our bottom-line results were disheartening, we made great progress last year in reacting to the pandemic and cutting costs, reducing capacity and significantly bolstering our liquidity. For fourth quarter, our overall cost performance was strong as we continued to meticulously manage spending. Excluding special items, our operating cost decreased 37% year over year to $3.2 billion and increased 7% year over year on a unit basis. Fuel expense was the largest driver of the year-over-year decrease, down 67%, with gallon consumption down 45% and price per gallon down 40%. Our fourth-quarter fuel price was at the midpoint of our guidance range at $1.25 per gallon, down $0.84 year over year. Following three quarters of lower fuel prices, energy market prices have increased recently. We currently expect a sequential increase of roughly $100 million in our first-quarter economic fuel cost compared with fourth quarter, despite slightly lower gallon consumption estimates in first quarter. We estimate our first-quarter fuel price to be in the $1.60 to $1.70 per-gallon range. Our 2020 fuel hedging portfolio remained materially unchanged throughout the year, and our premium cost per gallon increased in 2020, simply as a direct result of lower fuel gallons consumed. Our fourth-quarter premium expense of $24 million equated to $0.08 per gallon, and our full-year premium expense was $98 million, also $0.08 per gallon. Our 2020 portfolio outlook is similar to 2020 with estimated first-quarter premium expense of $25 million and full-year estimated premium expense of $100 million. Our hedging protection for 2021 currently reflects hedging gains that would begin at Brent prices around $65 per barrel with more material gains once you get to $80 per barrel. In addition to the cost tailwind from lower market fuel prices, our fourth-quarter fuel efficiency improved 8% year over year, driven by many of our older aircraft remaining parked and out of service given our capacity cuts. Fuel efficiency is also being helped by lower load factors, as well as strong on-time performance. We expect this trend to continue in first quarter and currently estimate fuel efficiency to improve by 5% to 6% year over year. Excluding fuel, special items and prior-year profit sharing, fourth-quarter operating costs were down 23% year over year, which was right in line with our guidance range. On a unit basis, the increase was 29% year over year, driven primarily by the significant reduction in year-over-year capacity. Our fourth-quarter capacity was down 41% year over year, which resulted in a reduction of approximately -- of $340 million of variable flight-driven costs, excluding fuel, primarily related to flights-driven maintenance expense, the landing fees and revenue-related and personnel costs. We also realized cost savings from the actions we've taken in response to the pandemic. We saved $425 million in salary wages and benefits in fourth quarter, driven by our employee voluntary leave programs. And we have reduced advertising expense and cut or deferred most of our projects and investments, as well as discretionary spending. We did have a few areas of increases in inflationary pressure, such as contractual pay rate increases, increases in airport rates and a greater pro rata share of airport expenses and higher aircraft rents from the sale-leaseback transactions that we completed in 2020. In total, I am very pleased with our cost performance and continued cost control in fourth quarter. I'll spend a few minutes recapping our employee voluntary leave programs since they are such a key component in managing our near-term cost. We had a strong 25% total participation rate by our employees, and that is 7% in the voluntary leave program with 18% participating in extended time off. I would also like to thank our 15,000 employees who participated in these very crucial programs to reduce our cost and cash burn. The total cost of these two voluntary programs is approximately $1.8 billion, if none of the pilots on an extended leave are recalled before the end of 2025, for those that selected a five-year time horizon. In that case, the NPV of the program through 2025 exceeds $2 billion. In terms of the accounting, we accrued approximately $1.4 billion of the total cost of the programs in 2020, and that covered the time period from second-quarter 2020 through the end of 2021. The $1.4 billion accrual is reflected as a special item in our annual 2020 non-GAAP results and includes all costs associated with the voluntary separation program and an assumption that there would be no material recalls of employees that elected extended time off at least through February 2022, which is 18 months from the beginning of that program. The remaining $400 million of program costs are related to employees who elected extended time off for longer than 18 months, which consists solely of pilots. Due to the uncertainty of the current environment, no accruals were recorded for extended time-off elections beyond this 18-month period. We will continue to closely monitor the demand environment, and, of course, record further accruals, if appropriate. We made cash payments to employees of approximately $450 million in 2020, pretty evenly split between third and fourth quarters. We expect 2021 cash payments for the program to be about $500 million, $175 million of that in first quarter. So those are the basics of the accounting for the program. And in terms of cost savings from these programs, we recognized lower salaries, wages and benefits of approximately $425 million in fourth-quarter 2020 and $565 million for full-year 2020. For 2021, we expect $600 million in incremental savings over and above 2020 for an estimated $1.2 billion in total savings from these programs this year or roughly $100 million per month. We continue to expect the annual run-rate savings from our voluntary separation program to be roughly $500 million beginning in 2022 and beyond. We are very happy with the success of these programs which provide significant savings. In addition, the extended leave programs give us a lot of flexibility should the business recover fast, and we determine we need to recall employees. Our swift self-help actions reduced our 2020 cash spending and outlays by approximately $8 billion compared with original plans. Breaking that down, our 2020 operating expenses, excluding fuel special items and profit sharing, were down $2.8 billion compared to plan. The benefit of fewer fuel gallons consumed from less capacity drove fuel savings of more than $1.5 billion. We reduced capital spending by $2.4 billion, taking into account proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions and supplier proceeds received. The remaining cash savings were driven primarily by the suspension of dividends and share repurchases. This is a tremendous testament to our people for their swift action and laser focus on strict cost control. Based on our current cost trends and capacity plans for first-quarter 2021, we expect first-quarter operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense and special items, to decrease in the range of 15% to 20% year over year. On a nominal basis, our estimated first-quarter operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense and special items, are relatively in line with our fourth-quarter results as capacity remains down, and we continue to benefit from savings driven by reduced capacity levels, as well as similar quarterly cost savings from our employee voluntary leave programs. While we are not providing full-year 2021 cost guidance, as long as capacity remains muted, we expect continued savings in variable flight-driven expenses, such as salary wages and benefits, fuel consumption, flight-driven maintenance expense and landing fees. We expect $600 million of incremental cost savings from our voluntary leave and extended time-off programs this year. And in terms of areas of pressure, we will have contractual pay rate increases. We anticipate rate inflation and airport costs. We expect an increase in depreciation and amortization, as well as aircraft rentals, as we resume a mix of owned and leased MAX deliveries and as we continue crucial technology and facility investments. We will also have more heavy maintenance checks, in particular, for our 800 fleet. Overall, changes in our nonfuel spending relative to 2020 will be mainly dependent on how our capacity plan evolves. To the extent costs are rising as a function of more flight activity, it will need to be supported by a recovery in revenue and the focus will be on operating margin and cash burn improvements. On a fuel-constant CASM basis, we continue to believe it is reasonable that we could get back to 2019 levels even with less capacity by the end of 2021. We had some cost inefficiencies this year from carrying excess staffing, which will impact our cost, although we are economically covered with the PSP extension. There have been significant cost reductions across the industry, and I would just caution that many of them are temporary during this depressed environment. For Southwest, we are a growth airline with a cost structure to support growth, and we don't believe we need to make structural changes to our strategy, business model, fleet, and product offering. We are very well-positioned for a recovery in travel demand and our focus on our long-term health and position within the industry rather than managing to a particular point in time during this pandemic. Our annual 2020 effective tax rate was 27.8% and being higher than the federal statutory tax rate. As we mentioned on our call last quarter, the CARES Act allows any losses created in 2020 to be applied to prior tax years beginning with 2015. As a full cash taxpayer for the past five years, we are able to take full advantage of this CARES Act provision and currently estimate a tax refund from our annual 2020 net loss carryback of approximately $470 million, which we expect to receive later this year. The higher tax rate is due to the net loss carryback provision being applied to a higher corporate tax rate of 35% in 2015 and 2016 until the passage of tax reform in 2017. For first-quarter 2021, we expect our tax rate to subside back to normal levels and be in the range of 21% to 22% as the NOL carryback provisions available in the CARES Act are not applicable to years beyond 2020. Turning to fleet and capex, I continue to feel very comfortable with our fleet flexibility over the next several years, whether through retirements to adjust to lower demand or through our ability to return aircraft to service to ramp up capacity when the environment supports growth. As Mike covered, we are focused on returning the MAX to revenue service on March 11. During fourth quarter, we reached an agreement with Boeing to take delivery of 35 MAX 8 aircraft through the end of 2021, including 16 leased aircraft. In December, we received seven of those, which were leased aircraft, and we expect the remaining 28 aircraft in 2021. Our current plan is to return 17 leased aircraft that expired this year, which would bring us to 729 aircraft at the end of this year, well below our fleet of 747 aircraft at the end of 2019. We do not have an updated order book to provide beyond 2021 as we are still in discussions with Boeing to restructure our longer-term order book. During 2020, we returned 12 leased 700 aircraft and retired 24 owned 700s, including the accelerated retirement of 20 owned 700s. Our decision to early retire these 20 aircraft resulted in an impairment charge of $32 million during fourth quarter, treat it as a special item, and we estimate that the operating savings will exceed this charge. And they will be replaced with new, more fuel-efficient MAX 8 aircraft. We ended 2020 with 718 aircraft in our fleet. Our annual 2020 capital spending totaled $515 million, which was more than offset by cash proceeds of $815 million from sale-leaseback transactions and $428 million in supplier proceeds received during 2020. When also factoring in minimal aircraft deliveries and the cancellation or deferral of the majority of our originally planned capital investment project for 2020, we significantly offset the $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion of capex originally planned for the year. We were successful in aggressively managing our capital spending throughout the pandemic in 2020, and we will continue to do the same in 2021. Our recent agreement with Boeing included the settlement of 2020 damages related to the MAX grounding. And as a result of delivery credits provided in the agreement, as well as progress payments made to date on undelivered delayed aircraft, we estimate an immaterial amount of aircraft capital spend in 2021. And we currently estimate our annual 2021 capital spending to be no more than $500 million, driven primarily by technology, facilities and operational investments. Compared with our original planning projections prior to the pandemic, we have reduced our combined 2020 and 2021 capital spending by approximately $5.5 billion. Before I wrap up and open the call up for questions, I'll provide an overview of our liquidity and cash burn. We ended fourth quarter with liquidity of $14.3 billion, including cash and short-term investments of $13.3 billion and our fully available $1 billion revolver. Since the onset of the pandemic, we were quick to reduce spend and bolster our cash position. We raised approximately $18.9 billion through debt issuances, sale-leaseback transaction, a common stock offering and payroll support program proceeds. Net of repayments, we ended the year with $10.3 billion in debt on our balance sheet, and we were in a net cash position of $3 billion and have leverage of 56%. We continue to have approximately $12 billion in unencumbered assets, and that doesn't include the significant value from our Rapid Rewards program. I am very pleased with our significant liquidity and substantial dry powder, should we need it as the pandemic persist here in 2021. We are grateful for the recent PSP extension of the PSP funding. We reached an agreement with the U.S. Treasury for at least $1.7 billion, of which $864 million has been received thus far in January. The remaining proceeds of $864 million are expected to be funded here in first quarter. The total proceeds will be funded as $1.2 billion in cash and $488 million in the form of a loan. We will also issue warrants to purchase nearly 1.1 million shares of common stock. And including the PSP funds received thus far, our cash balance as of yesterday was $13.9 billion. Turning to cash burn, our fourth-quarter average core cash burn was $12 million per day, as expected. And this was a sequential improvement from our rate of $16 million per day in third quarter and a continuation of the sequential improvement seen through 2020, despite the deceleration in revenue trends in November and December. Given current revenue trends, coupled with a seasonally weaker travel period in January and February and rising fuel prices, we currently estimate average core cash burn for first quarter to be approximately $17 million per day. The $5 million per-day sequential increase from fourth quarter is mostly driven by lower revenue and higher fuel prices. And keep in mind that our average core cash burn calculation does not factor in certain changes in working capital. Including changes in working capital, as we defined in our earnings release, our fourth-quarter 2020 cash burn was $15 million per day, $3 million per day higher than our primary core cash burn, driven almost entirely by fourth-quarter payments made for our voluntary employee leave programs. We currently estimate our first-quarter cash burn, including working capital, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million per day with the improvement driven primarily by changes in our ATL balance as bookings begin to build again, albeit not building at historical rates. One of our key goals is to achieve a cash burn breakeven in 2021. However, the timing of the necessary rebound in travel demand to meet this goal remains unpredictable. In closing, while 2020 was unpredictable and unprecedented to say the least, we are prepared for the current environment. And I am immensely proud of how our entire Southwest team is managing through it all. Coming into 2020, we had the strongest balance sheet in the U.S. airline industry, and we maintain that position today. As we navigate through the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic, we remain focused on maintaining our financial strength and substantial liquidity. With encouraging news on the vaccine front, we are hopeful that demand will rebound at some point this year. But until that occurs, we will remain focused on what we can control. We will continue to adjust capacity to varying demand levels, and we will continue the momentum from 2020 in terms of our cost control and focus on efficiency. We are managing our cash burn and have made good progress despite the revenue environment. We are pursuing new revenue pools through network expansion in GDS and have continued to make prudent investments for future growth. We are preparing for the return of the MAX in March. And with the much-needed PSP extension, we have another year of job security for our people. As our people have demonstrated again and again, they have what it takes to carry us through this pandemic, and we'll continue to be nimble as we manage through the uncertainties. We are blessed with many strengths, the greatest of which are our people. And I believe we will emerge from this environment with even more competitive advantages and opportunities for growth over the next decade. As our founder, Herb Kelleher, would say, ""We will not sit on our laurels."" And our track record speaks for itself. Our people are fighters, and we are all up for the challenges ahead. With that, Chad, we are ready to take analyst questions. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/28/southwest-airlines-luv-q4-2020-earnings-call-trans/
Southwest Airlines (LUV) Q3 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 22, 2020","Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us for our third-quarter earnings call for 2020. Obviously, we can't be happy or satisfied with the loss, but I'm going to tell you upfront some of the things that I'm happy and grateful for. Number one, the record loss was significantly less than I feared three months ago. We got past the July wobble in demand. Number two, our outlook for fourth quarter reflects a continuation of this improvement, better revenues, lower cost compared to the third quarter and assuming our October trends hold for November and December, and that's, of course, also assuming that we have stable fuel prices. Number three, we've announced nine new destinations to be added over the next three quarters. I'm happy to have these opportunities. I'm happy to play offense. I'm happy to generate more revenue on minimal incremental cost, which means more cash, and I'm happy to put idle aircraft and excess staff to work. Number four, I'm happy that there's still a chance that we can reserve pay, jobs and service by congress extending the Payroll Support Program for another six months. Getting that support extended is a top priority. I'm hopeful it will happen quickly so we can terminate work on our Plan B, which is to press our unions to sacrifice with concessions in order to prevent furloughs as we currently are roughly 20% overstaffed. Number five, I'm happy that, finally, we seem to be nearing the ungrounding of the MAX. Number six, I'm happy that we have the scientific evidence to provide comfort and assurance that it is safe to unblock the middle seats, which will happen on December 1, and the scientific support arrives as demand continues to improve, which should absorb our 50% increase in seats offered for sale. And our models show that this will be revenue, cost and operating profit positive, and that all makes me happy, too. I'm happy that we have at least three years of cash, and I know it's borrowed money, but that should see us through this crisis. And if we have to, we can borrow more. Number eight, I'm happy that we're uniquely prepared for this environment with our business model. We have low cost, low fares, no hidden fees and nothing to hide. No second class, the nation's best route system, the nation's largest airline, 97% domestic and better prepared than ever to serve business travelers when they return to the skies. And then finally, I'm enormously grateful for our people. They've done a phenomenal job monitoring and adjusting this airline. They've done a phenomenal job running a superb, safe, on-time, high-quality operation. They've done a phenomenal job serving our customers with industry-leading hospitality. And finally, I'm grateful for their resilience and their perseverance and their devotion to our cause. Our leaders are going to continue to do everything in their power to take care of all the people who have built and operate this airline and serve our customers every day. Job one is keeping our company financially strong and healthy and with perpetual competitive advantages. So those are a sampling of my favorite things. And yes, the worst may be behind us, and I hope there are no more surprises. And yes, we have a long way to go, but we will get through this. We will survive this, and we will emerge with the best balance sheet and the best business model to compete and thrive in the post pandemic world. And Mike, Tom and Tammy have a lot to share with you. So I'm going to wrap up and turn it over to Mr. Mike Van de Ven. ","Thank you, Tom, and hello, everyone. I'll round out today's comments with an overview of our cost performance, fleet, liquidity and cash burn before we move on to Q&A. Before I begin, so I'd like to extend a huge thank you to all of our Southwest warriors. You all are performing magnificently despite the challenges of this pandemic. The $1.2 billion net loss we reported on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis this morning certainly speaks to the staggering impact the pandemic has had on air travel demand and our business. Our GAAP results included two large special items: Payroll Support Program proceeds of $1.2 billion, which was mostly offset by $1.1 billion in charges for our voluntary separation and extended emergency time-off programs; as well as our normal fuel hedge special items. Speaking of our voluntary programs, I'd also like to thank our more than 15,200 employees who participated in these important programs to reduce our cost and cash burn. It has been emotional to see so many of our Southwest family members depart, and we are very, very grateful for their dedication and service to our incredible company. We are determined to make them proud and are focused on emerging from this pandemic stronger than ever. We had a strong 25% total participation rate by our employees in these two programs combined. And in addition to helping us cut our cost, the extended leave program gives us a lot of flexibility should the business recover faster, and we determine we need to recall employees. We had more than 4,200 employees elect the voluntary separation program. Our September 30 head count of nearly 58,000 full-time equivalent employees is down nearly 3,200 compared with June 30, which illustrates about 75% of voluntary leave participants left the company during third quarter. Virtually all of the remaining employees have separation dates by year-end. The total cost of these two voluntary programs could be up to approximately $1.7 billion if none of the pilots on extended time-off are recalled before the end of those that selected a five-year election period. The NPV of the program through 2025 exceeds $2 billion if there are no employees recalled early from the extended emergency time-off program. In terms of the accounting, we have now accrued approximately $1.4 billion in 2020 of the $1.7 billion potential cost of these programs, which includes all costs associated with the voluntary separation program and an assumption that there would be no material recalls of employees that elected extended time-off, at least through February of 2022, which is 18 months from the beginning of that program. We accrued approximately $300 million in second quarter and $1.1 billion in third quarter, which are reflected as special items in our non-GAAP results in both quarters. The remaining $300 million of program costs are related to employees who elected extended time-off for longer than 18 months, which consists solely of pilots. Due to the uncertainty of the current environment, no accruals were recorded for extended time-off elections beyond this 18-month period. We will closely monitor the demand environment and record further accruals, if appropriate. We made cash payments to employees of approximately $195 million in the third quarter, leaving our accrued program costs at about $1.2 billion. We expect our cash payments to be approximately $300 million in fourth quarter, about $500 million in 2021 and up to approximately $700 million in 2022 and beyond. In terms of the cost savings from these programs, we expect salary, wages and benefit cost savings of approximately $550 million in second half 2020, $143 million realized in the third quarter and over $400 million in fourth quarter. For 2021, we expect $500 million in incremental savings over 2020 for approximately $1.1 billion in total savings next year or over $90 million per month. We expect the annual run rate savings from our voluntary separation program to be roughly $500 million beginning in 2022 and beyond. And savings for the voluntary extended emergency time-off program could be up to almost $600 million in total for 2022 through 2025, if no employees are recalled from the extended emergency time off program. So the savings opportunity and flexibility the programs provide are substantial. We also recently shared that we are seeking the equivalent of a 10% pay reduction across all work groups in 2021, which would represent cost savings of at least $500 million beginning next year. These cost savings are crucial, especially in our largest cost category, as we aim to preserve jobs while achieving necessary and meaningful cost efficiencies in this suppressed capacity environment so that we are better positioned for a healthy and faster recovery. For third quarter, our overall cost performance was strong as we remained laser-focused on managing our costs. Excluding special items, our operating cost decreased 30.1% year-over-year to $3.4 billion and increased only 4.1% year-over-year on a unit basis. Our third quarter capacity was down 33% year-over-year, which resulted in approximately $330 million in reduced costs for our variable flight-driven nonfuel expenses, and that's primarily in salary, wages and benefits, maintenance expense and airport costs. We realized further cost savings driven by the actions we've taken in response to the pandemic. I already covered the cost savings from our voluntary leave program, which was $143 million in third quarter. By parking aircraft, we were able to defer flight hour-driven maintenance activities and further reduced our maintenance expense, which was included in the $330 million I mentioned previously. We also reduced our third quarter other operating expenses by more than $100 million by cutting advertising spend, technology projects and discretionary spending. Our cost performance continues to benefit from significantly lower energy prices, which saved us $257 million in third quarter alone compared with our expectations for third quarter fuel costs at the beginning of this year. Our third quarter fuel price was $1.23 per gallon, down $0.84 or 41% year-over-year. And based on our current fuel hedge and fourth quarter market prices, we estimate -- continued and welcomed a fuel price relief year over year with an estimated fourth quarter fuel price in the $1.20 to $1.30 per gallon range compared with $2.09 per gallon in the fourth quarter last year. Our fuel hedging portfolio continues to provide insurance against spikes in jet fuel prices with material upside protection, no floor risk and very manageable fuel hedging premium expense. We have not made material changes to our 2020 portfolio, and our premium cost per gallon has increased this year simply as a direct result of lower fuel gallons being consumed. Our third quarter premium expense of $24 million equates to $0.08 per gallon, and full year 2020 premium cost remains at $97 million, also $0.08 per gallon. For 2021, we expect premium expense to be similar to 2020 based on our current portfolio. Our hedging protection for 2021 is solid, with hedging gains that would begin at Brent prices around $65 per barrel with more material gains, once you get to $80 per barrel. In addition to the cost relief from lower market fuel prices, our third quarter fuel efficiency improved 10% year-over-year driven by many of our older aircraft being parked. We are also benefiting from lower load factors and better on-time performance, and we expect for this trend to continue in fourth quarter and currently estimate our fuel efficiency to be similar to what we realized in third quarter year over year. Excluding fuel, special items and prior year profit sharing, third quarter operating costs were down 17% year over year, which was toward the better end of our guidance range and increased 23.4% year over year on a unit basis, driven primarily by the significant reduction in capacity. Based on current plans for fourth quarter 2020 capacity to decrease approximately 40% year over year, fourth quarter operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense, special items and profit sharing expense, are expected to decrease in the range of 20% to 25% year over year. This represents a sequential improvement from third quarter driven primarily by lower capacity and additional cost savings from our voluntary leave programs. Our swift self-help actions have reduced our 2020 cash outlays by approximately $8 billion compared with our original plan. Our 2020 operating expenses, excluding fuel special items and profit sharing, are expected to be down $2.8 billion this year compared to plan. The benefit of fewer fuel gallons consumed from less capacity has driven fuel savings of more than $1.5 billion. We have reduced capital spending by $2.4 billion, taking into account proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions and supplier proceeds received, and the remaining savings are driven primarily by the suspension of dividends and share repurchases. In addition to these self-help actions, we benefited from the significant drop in fuel prices this year, which we estimate will save us another $1 billion in fuel costs compared with our expectations at the beginning of the year. That brings our total fuel savings compared with planned to more than $2.5 billion and our total cash outlay savings to approximately $9 billion compared with original plans. I am very proud of the Southwest Team and their diligence to realize these meaningful cash savings. Our effective tax rate for third quarter was 25%. The CARES Act allows any losses created in 2020 to be carried back five years for a refund of taxes paid and beginning in 2015. And as a full cash taxpayer for the past five years, we will be able to take advantage of this CARES Act provision with our projected 2020 net losses. Further, as our corporate tax rate was 35% prior to the passage of tax reform in 2017, our 2020 tax rate is trending higher than our year ago rate. This was due to the net loss carryback provision being applied to a higher prior year tax rate that drives the larger tax refund. We currently estimate our annual 2020 effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%. Turning to fleet and capex. We continue to be well positioned with our fleet flexibility over the next several years, whether through retirements to adjust to lower demand or through our ability to return aircraft to service to ramp up capacity if the environment supports growth. As a reminder, our interim agreement with Boeing from earlier this year is that we will take no more than 48 aircraft through the end of 2021. The environment has not improved since then, and it's certainly safe to say that we do not need 48 aircraft next year, at least for growth. We are in the process of restructuring our order book with Boeing and do not have a revised delivery schedule to share with you today, but we do hope to nail down the specifics soon. Our 2020 capital spending forecast remains unchanged. We have more than offset the $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion of capex originally planned for this year. We have been successful in aggressively managing our capital spending throughout this pandemic, and our goal is to do the same in 2021. While we are not prepared to provide 2021 capex guidance today, it's our full intention to keep 2020 capex to a minimum and low level, including any revision to our order book. Before I wrap up and open the call up for questions, I'll provide an overview of our liquidity. We ended third quarter with cash and short-term investments of $14.6 billion, and including our fully available $1 billion revolver liquidity of $15.6 billion. Since our last earnings call, we issued an additional $1 billion of unsecured debt, raised $121 million through an aircraft secured financing and received our full allocation of Payroll Support Program proceeds. We ended the quarter with a total of $10.9 billion in debt on our balance sheet, leaving us in a net cash position of $3.7 billion with leverage of 54%. We continue to have approximately $12 billion in unencumbered assets with approximately $10 billion in aircraft, and this doesn't include the significant value from our Rapid Rewards loyalty program. We remain laser-focused on reducing our core cash burn. And for third quarter, our average core cash burn was $16 million per day, which was a sequential improvement from our rate of $23 million per day in second quarter. This improvement was driven primarily by strengthening close end leisure demand and booking trends. And based on the strengthening of our fourth quarter revenue trends thus far, coupled with cost savings from our voluntary employee leave programs, we currently estimate core cash burn for October to be approximately $12 million per day and fourth quarter to be approximately $11 million per day. And remember that our core cash burn calculation does not factor in certain changes in working capital. During fourth quarter, we expect the most notable working capital change not included in our average daily core cash burn of $11 million to be driven by payments made for our voluntary employee leave programs, which will be nearly $300 million. We also anticipate normal seasonal swings in our air traffic liability balance with an expected seasonal drop-off in bookings later in the quarter due to the post-holiday slower time period, which could cause our cash burn, including working capital, to be higher than our core cash burn estimate of $11 million per day. Our current cash balance is $13.7 billion, which factors in a $500 million bullet maturity debt payment that we repaid earlier this month. Factoring in all the moving parts I just mentioned, we currently estimate our cash balance to be roughly $13 billion at the end of this year. And finally, we expect to have about 590 million in weighted average shares outstanding in fourth quarter, which is an increase of 27 million shares from second quarter due to the May 1 issuance of 80.5 million shares, which was included in the weighted average calculation for only two months in the second quarter. So in closing, we are proud to still have the U.S. industry's strongest balance sheet. We are the only domestic airline to be rated investment-grade by all three rating agencies, and our goal remains to protect our balance sheet and investment-grade ratings. We must see a significant rebound in revenues as we've covered today, but our efforts to boost liquidity, add new low-risk pools of revenue and ongoing focus to reduce cost and cash burn provide a solid foundation when they do allow us to rebuild our predominantly domestic network. While we've got a ways to go, our people have the grit, resolve and determination to carry us through this pandemic. And with any luck, the worst is hopefully behind us. So with that, Chad, we are ready to take analyst questions. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/23/southwest-airlines-luv-q3-2020-earnings-call-trans/
Southwest Airlines (LUV) Q2 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 23, 2020","Thank you Ryan, and good morning everybody, and thanks for joining us on our second-quarter earnings call. This is a record quarterly loss for us. And of course, that can never be something that we're pleased about. But since our last earnings call in April, we have accomplished a great deal and performed better than the goals that we laid out at the time. Most importantly, we've boosted our liquidity. We've cut operating costs. We've generated traffic momentum. We've cut our daily cash burn rate to $16 million a day in June. And importantly, our success in generating traffic was key and key to the next several quarters. We have a viable flight schedule for our customers to choose from. We're operating an extremely reliable airline. Our people are delivering exceptional hospitality. We committed to the Southwest Promise on May 1 to assure our employees and our customers that their safety comes first. And we're offering low fares with no hidden fees, and all that adds up to record high levels of customer satisfaction. And of course, that is crucial. We offered voluntary separation and extended leave program that closed on July 15, as we had planned. Almost 17,000 employees signed up. And we're working on reorganizing the company and adjusting our fourth-quarter flight schedule to roughly match our people capacity which year over year will be down roughly 25%. And the majority of the volunteers selected the extended leaves, and there'll be recalls if we need to add capacity quickly. And that gives us tremendous flexibility and significant cost savings over the next several years. Implementing this program is a major objective in the third quarter. And while we have a plan for pay cuts, benefit cuts, furloughs and layoffs, we do not intend to pursue any of those at least through the end of this year. COVID-19 cases surged unexpectedly this month, and the U.S. is an outlier, and of course, that is disappointing. And we've seen a dramatic impact to our trends as far as traffic revenue and bookings this month, and we've had to reduce what was a very credible revenue forecast for the third quarter by hundreds of millions of dollars. And we would have easily beat our second-quarter daily cash burn number but for that. We'll have to work harder now and adjust August and September capacity in order to meet our goal of continued reduction in daily cash burn. We were on a path to breakeven by the end of the year. That is still my goal, but first quarter may be more realistic. This year and probably the first half of next year will be a game of tactics and iterations. We're going to execute, we'll monitor and we'll constantly adjust. And that means the schedule, and our fares, and our spending. Overall, I'm very pleased. I'm very encouraged. We knew this would be a long sawtooth slog with a lot of unexpected twist and turns, and it's proving to be so. Our country and the world needs to beat this virus. Until then, we're going to have to be resilient. We're going to have to persevere, and we're going to have to manage. And I think everybody needs to understand that we know enough now to know that we have a long, long way to go. And we will manage to sustain the health of our company, accordingly. We were very well prepared for this. We're prepared for a prolonged war against this pandemic. Our people have literally done all they have been asked and I could not be more proud. And I have never seen anything like this in my life. But after these many months of battle, I am more confident than ever that we will not just survive, but we will thrive. So we have a lot to cover this morning before we get to your questions. So with that very quick overview, let me quickly turn the call over to Bob Jordan, our executive vice president, who, among other things, is going to talk about our voluntary separation program and extended time off. Bob? ","Thank you Tom, and hello everyone. I'll round out our comments today with an overview of our cost performance, our liquidity, cash burn and fleet before we open it up for questions. Before I begin, I also want to say a big thank you to all of our incredible teams. This might be the toughest challenge we've ever faced in our history, at least during my career at Southwest. But there is a reason we refer to our employees as warriors. I just couldn't imagine a more talented and determined group of people to be working alongside as we fight to overcome this crisis to keep southwest healthy and strong for decades to come. Coming into the second quarter, our top financial priority was to boost liquidity and reduce cash burn to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on our business. With our revenue production down dramatically, we took swift action to reduce spend. We essentially eliminated our capital spend, apart from key investments in important projects, such as GDS we deferred or canceled nonessential discretionary spend. And we implemented voluntary and unpaid fleet program with strong take rates, as Bob already covered. And as Mike covered, we did all of this while running a high-quality operation, and our people took great care of our customers. For our second quarter alone, our actions resulted in savings of $3.5 billion in spend versus what we were planning coming into this year. Our second-quarter cost performance and cash spending were in line with the expectations we laid out at the time of our last earnings call. And excluding several items, our second-quarter nominal expenses decreased 36% year over year and decreased nearly 40% versus our pre pandemic plan. And that was on a year-over-year capacity decline of 55%. And our average course cash spend came in around $34 million per day in second quarter. As a reminder, our original pre-pandemic outlook for second-quarter core cash spend was in the range of $60 million to $65 million per day. So the swift actions taken to reduce our costs were very meaningful. In addition to the operating expense relief as a result of lower capacity, lower fuel prices continued to help. Our second-quarter fuel price was $1.33 per gallon, down $0.80 or 38% year over year. And while recent fuel prices have increased from the low seen in first quarter, we're continuing to see significant year over year relief from lower energy prices. Lower market fuel prices saved us $153 million in second quarter alone compared to market price outlooks at the beginning of this year. For our third quarter, we estimate a fuel price in the $1.20 to $1.30 per gallon range with nearly $300 million in savings from the decrease in market prices since the beginning of the year and significantly lower than last year's third quarter fuel price of $2.07 per gallon. We do not have forward risk. So our fuel hedging program allows us to fully participate in falling market prices. While we have not made material changes to our 2020 portfolio, the percentage hedged in our premium cost per gallon have increased as a direct result of lower fuel gallons being consumed. Our second-quarter premium expense, albeit $4 million lower year over year at $24 million, spiked to $0.12 per gallon compared with $0.05 per gallon in second quarter last year. This higher premium cost per gallon will continue to be higher by default as long as capacity is down. But the $97 million fuel hedging premium cost this year remains unchanged. In addition, to lower fuel prices, our fuel efficiency improved 14.5% year over year driven by many of our older aircraft being parked. Lower load factors and a less congested airspace leading to less taxi and idle ground time and better on-time performance. Excluding fuel and special items, second-quarter operating costs were down 24% year over year. We saw significant relief in our variable flight driven nonfuel expenses primarily in salary wages and benefits, maintenance expense and airport costs. We have cut spending in virtually every category. Our 2020 operating expenses are now expected to be down over $2.7 billion this year compared with original plans, and this includes the benefit of fewer fuel gallons consumed from lower capacity. We had several special items in second quarter that we covered in this morning's press release. First, we had a fuel hedge special item that resulted in $21 million of expense that has been excluded from our second-quarter results. Second, we recognized a 225 -- $222 million gain from sale-leaseback transactions and other operating expenses. And as a reminder, this covered 10 737-800 aircraft and 10 737 MAX 8 aircraft. These were essentially financing transactions as part of our efforts to bolster liquidity, and the quality of the aircraft and market conditions resulted in the sizable gain. And third, we had $1.1 billion of payroll support program proceeds allocated to second quarter that were an offset to salary wages and benefits net against an accrual of $307 million related to our voluntary separation program. We've already covered the specifics on the take rates on the voluntary programs, but I want to add my thank you to the employees that elected to participate. Looking at third quarter, we expect the remaining $1.2 billion in payroll support program proceeds to be recorded as an offset to salary wages and benefits as well as an estimated charge in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion related to voluntary employee programs, as Bob covered. Nearly half of the cash payouts for the voluntary separation program will occur by year-end, and we expect overall savings of both programs to far exceed the upfront cost. Overall, we had a stellar second-quarter cost performance, and it is truly a testament to the swift actions and intense focus by the entire Southwest team. Based on current plans for third quarter 2020 capacity to decrease in the range of 20% to 30% year over year, third quarter operating expenses excluding fuel and oil expense, special items and profit sharing expense, are expected to decrease in the range of 10% to 20% year over year. This represents a sequential increase from second quarter driven primarily by higher flight-driven expenses and certainly are modest relative to the sequential increase in capacity. With regard to our capital spend forecast, we have more than offset the $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion of capex originally planned for this year. The reduction is driven by our 2020 and 2021 fleet delivery agreement with Boeing, canceling or deferring the majority of capital investment projects originally planned for this year; and supplier proceeds and sale leaseback proceeds, both of which we consider as reductions to aircraft capex. In regards to our fleet, I continue to feel very comfortable with our fleet flexibility over the next several years. Our latest agreement with Boeing and our current planning assumptions are that we will take no more than 48 aircraft through the end of 2021. We don't have the specifics finalized with Boeing yet, and that is by design, as the agreement gives us time and flexibility to continue monitoring demand and fleet needs for the next 18 months. There have been no formal updates to our contractual book order with Boeing yet, and the order book included in our first-quarter 10-Q is still reflective of the overall contractual agreement with orders and options for more than 330 MAX aircraft through the end of 2026, in addition to the no more than 48 we are evaluating for 2020 and 2021 combined. At some point, we'll need to adjust 2020 and 2021 deliveries down and shift delivery slots by year, but we have not canceled any of our orders or options with Boeing over the life of the agreement. We are well positioned to be nimble and rightsizing our fleet, whether through retirements to adjust to lower demand or to return aircraft to service and ramp up our capacity once the environment allows. Moving now to liquidity. We ended second quarter with cash and short-term investments of $14.5 billion, and we currently have a cash balance of $14 billion. Since our last earnings call, we have raised more than $10 billion to further bolster our cash reserves. In addition to financing and sale-leaseback transactions, we raised $2.2 billion through a common stock offering and have received $2.9 billion in payroll support program proceeds. And the remaining $326 million is expected by the end of this month. We also paid back our $1 billion revolver and paid off our $3.7 billion one year secured term loan which released $4.5 billion in aircraft collateral. We now have approximately $12 billion in unencumbered assets with approximately $10 billion in aircraft. And that doesn't include the significant value from our Rapid Rewards loyalty program, I'll just point out. In addition, we noted in our press release this morning that we have signed a letter of intent with the U.S. treasury to apply for a $2.8 billion loan as part of the Cares Act. We are not committed to taking this loan, and we haven't decided that we will take the loan yet. Signing the letter of intent was just part of the process to keep this loan as a backstop, should we determine we need it down the road. Taking into account 2020 operating expense. Savings of over $2.7 billion, the cash saved through the suspension of dividends and share repurchases and reduce capital spending, we have reduced our 2020 cash outlays by over $7 billion versus plan. That is very meaningful, and it took the teamwork of all of our employees to make such a big and impactful shift in such a short amount of time. Of course, these changes are necessary to manage our core cash burn, and we are doing just that. To clarify, our core cash spend, I already covered for second quarter, is meant to quantify the true run rate of our ongoing cost. Our average core cash burn takes our spending and incorporates the benefit of operating revenues net of trip cancellations. For second quarter, our average core cash burn was $23 million per day with a rate of $16 million per day in June, a little ahead of the guidance due to solid cost control and revenue trends holding up well for the vast majority of the month. Our current estimate for core cash burn for July is approximately $18 million per day, with third quarter estimated to be similar to second quarter's $23 million per day. As core cash burn remains our focus, we will continue to explore opportunities to improve our burn rate as we are currently doing with our reevaluation of our August and September flight schedule. In closing, we have the U.S. industry's strongest balance sheet. We are the only domestic airline to be rated investment-grade by all three rating agencies even after debt raises. We are in a net cash position of over $4 billion with a leverage of 49%, and our goal remains to protect our balance sheet and investment-grade rating. We came into this crisis in a strong position and have bolstered our liquidity to put us in an even stronger competitive position to manage through this uncertain time and to thrive out on the other side of this crisis. While no one knows how the pandemic will continue to unfold in the coming months, from where we sit today, I am encouraged by the resilience and determination of our people, and we remain laser-focused on taking care of our employees customers and our shareholders. With that, Chad, we are ready to take questions. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/23/southwest-airlines-luv-q2-2020-earnings-call-trans.aspx
Southwest Airlines Co (LUV) Q1 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 28, 2020","Thanks, Ryan, and good morning everybody and thanks for joining our first quarter 2020 earnings call. It's all about COVID-19 effects of course, our route system is over 95% domestic. We had a very strong January and February performance with solid unit revenue growth and better than expected cost performance. Earnings were higher in each month year-over-year. Our operation was performing magnificently and that's in terms of on-time performance and baggage handling and our customer service scores are industry leading. We saw no COVID-19 effects on bookings until the end of February and the effects on bookings and cancellations and traffic beginning in March were unprecedented and quite frankly breathtaking. So here we are, one of Southwest greatest and most enduring strengths is preparedness, and we were prepared on the heels of last year's outstanding performance and despite the MAX grounding and the excellent momentum there continued into January-February, we're in a very strong and healthy position when the coronavirus struck. We started the year in March with the surplus of liquidity, and that was by well over $1 billion. We began this year with the smallest amount of debt to total capital in our history, only 24% and on a $27 billion balance sheet, we had over $10 billion of unencumbered aircraft. While no one anticipated this economic catastrophe, we were prepared. And Mike, Tom and Tammy will detail all the actions taking --taken since March 1. But in summary, including spending cuts, schedule reductions, fuel price declines and the elimination of shareholder returns, we reduced our planned spending for 2020 by over $6 billion. Excluding working capital changes and proceeds from the payroll support program of the CARES Act, our cash burn for April is roughly $900 million and that includes capex and debt service. Our goal will be to drive that lower in May and June through more aggressive schedule cuts and hopefully increasing revenues. The pure cash outflows or spending has been cut in half from pre-COVID levels. Our financial management philosophy has always been and will continue to be very conservative. It has served us well. And no one can match the track record of profitability or the financial position of Southwest Airlines. No one has served shareholders or bondholders better over the last 49 years, and we intend to continue that record. Cash in this environment is an asymmetrical risk, not enough, that is a huge problem. Too much we'll pay down debt or we'll buy available assets opportunistically. We're in a recession, and historically, it has taken years typically five or more for business travel to recover, with some businesses issuing no travel orders that has to be the expectation going forward. The business travel will recover very slowly. Further, this recession has already put tens of millions of Americans out of work, and consumer sentiment has been severely damaged that will also affect near term travel demand expectations. And finally, for those who are willing and able to travel, the country needs to open back up so there is something for people to do when they get there. So I mentioned all of this to underscore the imperative of low cost in this environment. Because every traveler will demand low fare. That's our business model and we are America's strongest and most successful low fare carrier. We are working on a variety of things: number one, strategic plans that are based on three basic recovery scenarios, and that's being led by our President, Tom Nealon. We're working on customer experience modifications at the airport and on the airplane to ensure the customers feel safe. We're working on our capital structure and liquidity needs to see us through this pandemic, so that we emerge healthy and strong. We're obviously working on the fleet and that's being led by our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Van de Ven. And then last we're working on early retirement and other voluntary exit or reduced work programs for our employees. So before I pass to Mike, I want to thank all of our employees. This has been a crisis unprecedented in our history. But our people, our battle hardened, they are resilient and they are fearless and they have done a masterful job running the airline, serving our customers and implementing myriad new procedures and protocols. And they are all viable to this company, and they are essential to our country and they are my heroes. I'm very grateful to our employees and I'm very grateful to our leaders for keeping Southwest strong. And with that, Mike, I'll hand it over to you sir. ","All right, thank you, Tom. I'm happy to round out today's comments with a discussion on our costs, liquidity and fleet, before we move to Q&A. With our revenue production dramatically uptrend and Tom just covered, we are clearly focused on controlling our cost and preserving cash. I want to comment our employees for their quick work to rally together to reshape our cost trajectory in the near term. I'd also like to take a very quick moment to recognize our finance teams, legal team, governmental affairs team, commercial and operations teams really all Southwest teams for their tireless efforts over the past week. Today's rapidly changing environment calls for rapidly evolving financial scenarios and forecast, and actions. And our people have risen to the task day-after-day and often night-after-night. They are truly warriors in the face of this significant challenge, and I want to considerly thank them for their continued efforts. Our first quarter unit cost trends illustrate how diligent we have been to reduce cost quickly. Despite first quarter capacity declining nearly 7% year-over-year, which was 5 points to 6 points lower than we previously expected, first quarter CASM, excluding fuel and profit sharing increased only 5.1% year-over-year. For March alone, we were able to save approximately $100 million in non-fuel cost based on self help measures despite roughly 75% of our cost structure being fixed, due to the sudden fall off in demand coupled with closing capacity reduction. We saved another roughly $150 million in first quarter from less gallons consumed and the falling fuel prices, with roughly half of the savings coming from fewer gallons. In second quarter capacity is expected to be down at least 60% and we are estimating operating expenses to be down around 35% both versus original expectations prior to the pandemic. If you factor in the benefit from the fuel price decline, costs are expected to be down nearly 40% in second quarter versus plan. So between our variable cost relief and self-help actions we are seeing significant relief on the cost side relative to capacity cut. These combined efforts have resulted in a reduction of more than $2 billion in full year 2020 operating expenses. In terms of capital spending we have virtually eliminated all expenditures this year with over $1 billion in canceled or deferred projects and reduced aircraft delivery payments. We canceled our deferred hundreds of projects this year, but we are continuing to work on several critical work streams, such as our recent GDS launch that Tom covered. We have a new agreement with Boeing and are currently working with them on our revised aircraft delivery and payment schedules for 2020 and 2021. The agreement allows us to take no more than 48 aircraft through the end of 2021. We have not nailed down the specifics and we have some time to do so. But for 2020 at this point we currently expect to receive fewer than the 27 MAX aircraft that we were previously planning for this year. Between our work with Boeing and our retirement plans for our -700 fleet, I feel very comfortable with our fleet flexibility over the next several years both to flex down or up as needed. And of course, we are mindful that the environment is fluid and dynamic and we want to position ourselves to be able to adjust quickly based on a recovery of travel demand or to a prolonged recovery with no growth. We have included our March 31 order book in our 10-Q that was filed this morning, and it isn't updated yet for this agreement, however, for 2020 and 2021 deliveries excluding the 16 leased aircraft with third parties we have reduced our contractual deliveries with Boeing by at least 59 aircraft or roughly half. I am proud of what we have accomplished quickly and it is showing up in significantly lower cash burn in second quarter. Our original outlook for second quarter pre-pandemic was average core cash burn in the range of $60 million to $65 million per day. With actions to date, we now estimate our second quarter average core cash burn to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million per day. And to be very, very clear, the average core cash burn that I'm sharing includes cash outflows, capital expenditures and debt service, but excludes the impacts from cash sales, refunds and proceeds from financing transactions and the payroll support program. Of course, we shared that we aren't seeing much in terms of bookings for the second quarter, in terms of revenue -- excuse me, in terms of refund roughly 80% of our tickets sold are non-refundable. Therefore, the majority of trip cancellations have resulted in issuances of travel credit. For March, when trip cancellations peaked to record levels, total cash refunds were approximately $250 million, as for in April, cash refunds are running roughly half that of March and total trip cancellations, somewhat elevated are much lower given the large cycle this month. So that brings me to a few thoughts I'd like to share with you on air traffic liability. As of March 31, air traffic liability was $6.2 billion, of which $3.6 billion or 60% was our loyalty program balance outstanding for Rapid Rewards. About a third of our total air traffic liability balance represents travel credits that have already been issued around $2.1 billion. So that leaves a balance of $500 million to $600 million net, that is not related to Rapid Rewards or issue travel credits that we expect to fly in future months. And this represents less than 10% of our total air traffic liability, which is very manageable. On the comps front, I want to highlight one area that has really helped. Our employees are pitching in to really save the company money by participating in voluntary time off and temporarily programs. We had almost 490,000 hours reduced from these programs in March alone saving us an estimated $15 million in salaries and wages. We have over 3,000 employees utilizing voluntary leave and partial pay programs in April and for May we currently have more than 7,000 employees electing to take voluntary leave. As we adapt to a dramatically reduced flight schedule, we know we have to look at how best to manage our workforce and limit impact to our people. We have extended leave programs through the end of August and we are also considering options for voluntary early retirement along with long-term leave program. I'll share a few quick comments on fuel. Our first quarter fuel price was a $1.90 per gallon down $0.15 or 7.3% year-over-year. Brent crude oil, average $51 per barrel in first quarter, but the real story is the dramatic fall off in prices with Brent crude oil at $69 per barrel in early January and ending at a low of $23 per barrel by the end of March. We continue to see significant relief from lower energy prices, lower market fuel prices saved us $80 million in first quarter compared to market prices at the beginning of the year. For second quarter, we estimate fuel price in the $1 to $1.10 per gallon range, which is down nearly $200 million since the beginning of the year, and significantly lower than last year's second quarter fuel price of $2.13 per gallon. When considering the reduction of fuel gallons this year due to capacity cuts, we currently estimate 2020 fuel expense to be down over $2 billion from beginning of year levels, which is much welcome relief on costs in cash in this low revenue environment. Our fuel hedging program allows us to fully participate in following market prices, which has continued to fall even in recent days due to the lack of poor risk in our portfolio. And while we have not made any adjustments to our hedges for 2020, the percentage hedge in our premium cost per gallon has increased as a direct result of lower fuel gallons being consumed. This will continue to be the case as long as capacity is drastically reduced, but the $97 million fuel hedging premium cost this year remains unchanged. For example, we are more than 100% hedged in second quarter, triggering a GAAP loss of $2 million in first quarter other gains and losses from mark-to-mark adjustments that were recognized in other comprehensive income in prior periods. And our second quarter premium expense albeit $4 million lower year-over-year and $24 million spiked at $0.12 per gallon compared with the $0.05 per gallon in the second quarter last year. I simply want to point out that there isn't movement related to our hedging positions or premium costs in 2020. There is just noise in the metrics related to the significant reduction in fuel gallon due to capacity cuts. Despite the ongoing grounding of the fuel-efficient MAX fleet, our first quarter fuel efficiency improved 0.9% year-over-year due to reduced capacity in March. As we have flights we operated fewer of our less fuel-efficient aircraft which led to a slight improvement year-over-year. And we should see further improvement year-over-year and second quarter for the same reasons. Finally, a few more quick thoughts on liquidity. We ended first quarter with cash and short-term investments of $5.5 billion and we currently have a cash balance of over $9 billion. We included in our press release this morning the detail of the sources of incremental cash this year which totaled $6.8 billion through yesterday. So I won't list those again. But we aren't done. We remain laser focused on reducing our cash burn and evaluating other sources of liquidity to further bolster our cash reserves. And we are in a great position to do so. Our goal is to add capital in a way that protects the balance sheet and our investment grade rating, while addressing liquidity issue, so that we are prepared for any scenario well into 2021. We are the only domestic airline to be rated investment grade by all three rating agencies. And even after our financing transactions thus far, we still have over $6 billion an unencumbered aircraft and roughly $2 billion in other unencumbered assets, such as real estate, spare engines and ground equipment to name a few. In closing and to reiterate our comments today, we are focused on keeping our employees and customers safe, conserving cash, adjusting our flight schedules and fleet as necessary, and leveraging our strong balance sheet and financial position to further boost our liquidity. Despite our first quarter net loss, we still generated pre-tax return on invested capital of 18.1% or 14.3% after tax on a trailing 12 month basis. We have a proven track record with a seasoned leadership team that has successfully managed through uncertain times. We don't know how this crisis will continue to evolve and we don't know what the recovery will look like, from air travel to the broader economy, but we came into this crisis as the best prepared US airlines and we plan to emerge as the best prepared US airlines, both financially and operationally. With that Chad, we are ready to take analysts questions. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/28/southwest-airlines-co-luv-q1-2020-earnings-call-tr.aspx
Southwest Airlines Co (LUV) Q4 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 23, 2020","Thank you, Ryan and thanks to everyone for joining us for our fourth quarter and year end 2019 earnings call. Straight away I want to thank our employees. This is our 49th year and there, at least in my experience, there is no more remarkable year than 2019. The grounding of effectively 75 of our airplanes which is about 10% of our fleet presents a crisis like challenge, and our people are ready for it with the best planning, tools and technologies in our history, but more importantly with the right fortitude and the right resolve to get through this crisis. Our objectives were to run a great airline, serve our customers exceptionally well, protect our finances and our jobs, and follow through with our capital projects that were under way, and we were able to do all those things. The MAX groundings reduced our annual operating income $828 million. Our earnings were still a record on a per share basis -- non-GAAP basis at $4.27, and that is truly remarkable. But they would have been 28% higher and 20% -- 27% more than a year ago, but for the MAX. When you can do the math on the stock price effect, but we settle with Boeing for the 2019 MAX groundings and the settlement seems to have zero effect on the price per share by the way. But we also intend to settle up 2020 as well. So we're three months later since our last earnings call and unfortunately we're still talking about the MAX unhappily. I'm confident about the MAX. More importantly, our pilots are confident about the MAX. Boeing needs to get the work done to get the certification flight done, give the FAA a chance to do their work and unground this airplane. Right now we're scheduled for June 6th return which implies an ungrounding several months before. Boeing surprised us all this week with our June, July predictions about the grounding, and obviously that would make our and other airlines' June dates unworkable. So the timing remains uncertain. And we're working through all of that right now. Our goals for 2020, given all of this are very straightforward. We want to return the MAX to service. We want to continue to run a great operation, in fact even better. We want to continue to serve our customers very well with exceptional hospitality and in fact even better. We want to protect our finances and our jobs and continue to keep costs low and slow the rate of inflation and do that even better. We want to settle with Boeing for 2020 compensation. We want to continue on with the capital projects that are under way. And then finally, we want to keep our network intact and continue making what modest tactical adjustments we're able to do. Having said all those things and all assumes that demand in the economy remains strong and that oil prices remain stable and low. If we can continue to execute against all these goals, that means that we only have one problem, and that's fleet growth. So with regard to the fleet, we're assuming that the MAX grounding is short-lived, meaning there are months to go and not years to go. And with that in mind, we are aggressively pursuing a couple of tactical ideas. Number 1 is mainly our 700 retirement schedule where we have a lot of flexibility. So we're actively deferring retirements where it makes sense. Secondly, we're always monitoring the used 737 aircraft market, we'll continue to do that. Our issue is simple. It is our seat growth is not keeping up with demand, much less allowing us to expand and we're losing share. But all that is temporary and we plan to aggressively recapture it once the MAX is ungrounded in our -- in a superb position given our return on invested capital. There is no change in our efforts to evaluate the risk reward of a single aircraft type or supplier. We'll do that. It's just a lower 2020 priority. So there is no update there. I'll also pre-empt the M&A question by repeating what I've said earlier. I do not agree that the MAX crisis compels us to acquire another carrier. We would not overpay. We would not commit us to a course and consistent with our strategy. And of course as is or a policy, we do not comment on rumors or speculation about any M&A activity. And then finally, I want to thank our Board for making an amendment for 2019 profit sharing. And even though the Boeing compensation is for 2019, it is not included in 2019 profits and that's not fair to our people for their profit sharing. So as a result of that, $124 million was added and of course that reduced our fourth quarter profits, but that makes the total annual profit sharing contribution, a record $667 million and our folks earned it and just wanted to congratulate them. So taking that notable item into account, we'd be consistent -- consensus. So with that quick overview. I'd like to turn it over to Mr. Van de Ven to take us through our operations. ","Thank you, Tom, and hello everyone. I'd also like to thank all of our employees for their tremendous effort, managing through a very challenging year. The MAX groundings have had a significant impact on our Company. But our employees continue to rise to the occasion, and the strong results we reported this morning simply would not have been possible without their hard work and incredible focus and teamwork. With the MAX returned to service timeline shifting frequently, it has been difficult to anchor our full-year 2020 forecast to support meaningful guidance for the full year, so I'll focus primarily on first quarter guidance and my comments today regarding our cost performance, fleet capacity and capex plans, and our strong financial position. During fourth quarter, as Gary covered, we reached a confidential agreement with Boeing for compensation related to 2019 financial damages due to the MAX groundings, the compensation from Boeing will be accounted for as a reduction of the purchase price of our 31-owned MAX aircraft and future MAX from orders, which reduces property and equipment on our balance sheet and will result in lower depreciation expense over the useful life of the aircraft. In light of this agreement, our Board of Directors authorized a $124 million pre-tax profit sharing awards. This incremental award was accrued in fourth quarter and reduced fourth quarter earnings by $97 million or $0.18 per diluted share as we covered in the release. A record $264 million in fourth quarter profit sharing expense included a $124 million discretionary award and will be paid later this quarter as part of the record $667 million full-year 2019 profit sharing distribution to employees. Now that I've covered profit sharing, I'll go ahead and cover fuel costs before I move into our cost performance, excluding fuel and profit sharing. Our fourth quarter fuel price of $2.09 per gallon decreased $0.16 or 7.1% year-over-year and that's primarily due to a roughly an 8% decrease in market prices. We have a great fuel hedging protection in place this year with a 60% hedge for first quarter and a 59% hedge for full-year 2020. We've been adding some protection to future years and are currently about 54% hedged for 2021 and about 31% hedged for 2022. We also recently began adding modest protection to 2023 and expect to continue our systematic approach to building a meaningful multi-year hedging portfolio at a reasonable cost to provide some insurance on -- around -- was about a third of our cost structure. For first quarter 2020, based on market prices as of January 17, we expect our fuel price to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.15 per gallon, with a modest $0.01 hedging gain at current prices. Our fuel efficiency continues to be significantly impacted by the MAX groundings. We came into 2019 expecting a solid year-over-year improvement in our fuel efficiency, largely driven by the operating performance of the 75 MAX aircraft we should have had in 2019. As a reminder, the MAX produces a 20% fuel burn improvement over our retired classic fleet and a 14% improvement over our NG fleet. However, our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 ASMs per gallon declined 0.8%, so we lost some ground last year. We'll continue to be impacted until the return of the MAX and first quarter 2020 ASMs per gallon are also expected to decline year-over-year in the range of down 2% to 3%. We look forward to reversing this trend and getting back on track with our fuel efficiency improvement goal. Excluding fuel and profit sharing, the 5% year-over-year increase in our fourth quarter CASM-ex was right in line with our most recent guidance. And as we outlined in our release, the primary driver of the year-over-year increase was the temporary underutilization of overhead, combined with the lower-than-planned capacity from the MAX grounding. For full-year 2019, our CASM-ex increased 7.7% year-over-year. The MAX grounding impact drove approximately 5 points of this year-over-year inflation, which is what we expected. Excluding the MAX impact, our cost control was very solid with core year-over-year 2019 unit cost performance slightly below our original CASM-ex guidance range of 3% to 3.5%. And that includes the incremental $10 million of maintenance expense to keep seven of the -700 aircraft that we were originally going to retire in 2019, as well as the incremental $42 million ratification true-up for our mechanics contract. Looking at first quarter of 2020, we expect our CASM-ex to increase in the 6% to 8% range year-over-year. Our outlook includes an estimated 7 point unit cost penalty from the MAX groundings as our fleet deficit grows relative to our cost base. We will continue to have temporarily unabsorbed overhead that will be utilized upon the MAX return to service. Setting the MAX aside, our first quarter CASM-ex outlook would also include 1 point to 2 points of inflation, primarily due to increases in salary wages and benefits, maintenance expense and operating expenses related to technology and facility investments. As you know, we have year-over-year tailwinds related to the first quarter of 2019 impacts, associated with the ratified labor agreement with our mechanics and costs associated with unscheduled maintenance disruption and flight cancellations, which offsets inflationary pressures here in first quarter. Turning to an overview of our fleet plan, this has obviously been a focus for us this year with the MAX grounding. So, I'll spend a little more time walking you through all the moving parts. Prior to the MAX groundings, our 2019 plans were for 44 MAX deliveries, that was 37 MAX 8s and seven MAX 7s, along with 18 -700 retirements. This would have resulted in a fleet of 776 at year-end 2019. Instead, we had three MAX 8 deliveries, plus six -700 retirements and therefore ended 2019 with a total fleet of 747 aircraft. We took delivery of three 737 MAX 8 aircraft in first quarter before the MAX groundings in mid-March. We have not taken any delivery since then and as a result, we decided to postpone seven of the 18 planned retirement for 2019 to help mitigate a portion of our fleet deficit. We'll operate these seven aircraft for around two more years and they are scheduled to retire by the end of 2021. Of the remaining 11 -700 retirements planned for 2019, we retired six of them, one in third quarter and five during fourth quarter. The remaining five retirements have shifted to first half of 2020. We have not updated our contractual delivery schedule with Boeing. The 41 MAX aircraft that we didn't receive in 2019, are still in flux. But in our contractual order book schedule shown in our earnings release this morning, we reflected 40 of those deliveries as part of our 2020 firm orders and one as a 2021 firm order. However, I will provide some context as far as our current planning assumptions, because we do not expect to receive 78 aircraft deliveries at this point in 2020. The news from Boeing two days ago that the MAX will likely not return to service until mid-2020 has us now reevaluating our fleet and capacity plans further. Mike has already taken you through some of the details of our MAX return-to-service plans and he referenced the two sources of MAX aircraft that we are currently focused on as part of our 2020 fleet planning assumptions. Mike is working through the plan to safely return the 34 MAX 8s already in our fleet and we will also be working with Boeing and the FAA to deliver the 27 MAX 8 aircraft that are built and in storage. At this juncture, our current planning scenario is for 27 MAX deliveries in 2020. That brings us to around 60 MAXs which we are currently staffed to operate. We also expect to retire 16 -700 aircraft this year, the five that shifted from 2019 and 11 more planned throughout the year. This is less than the 20 to 25 that we previously communicated and that's simply due to the slower assumed ramp up of MAX production and delivery catch up. We will invest approximately $12 million this year into those 11 aircraft that we're extending for a few years. Based on our planning assumption that I walked through, we would add a modest 11 net aircraft to our fleet in 2020 at 758 total aircraft. Of course, we don't have certainty on the timing of the MAX return to service, the production timeline from Boeing or our aircraft delivery timeline. So, this is all subject to change and we'll keep you updated accordingly. Shifting to capacity, fourth quarter 2019 ASMs declined 0.9% year-over-year, which as expected, was about 8 points lower than our original plan. Our full-year 2019 capacity declined 1.6% year-over-year and was significantly lower than our original plan to grow nearly 5% in 2019. For first quarter 2020, we currently expect our ASM capacity to decline in the range of down 1.5% to 2.5% year-over-year. We currently have MAX flying removed through June 6, but with Boeing's latest guidance, we'll likely extend our MAX-related flight adjustments further. So, based on the flight schedule adjustments through June 6, we expect second quarter 2020 capacity to increase no more than 2%. So, now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with robust cash and short-term investments of approximately $4.1 billion. Our cash balance continues to be higher than what we usually carry, as we haven't been making aircraft delivery payments since mid-March 2019. Delayed delivery payments also lowered our capex to $1 billion in 2019 versus our original plan of $1.9 billion to $2 billion. The majority of the 2019 spend related to technology and facility investment. And, we also received a $400 million in supplier proceeds, which we consider an offset to our capital expenditures. For 2020, if you assume we get the 27 MAX 8s from Boeing that are already built for us, that would result in total capex of approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, which is net of a supplier proceeds owed to us at year-end 2019. Our cash flow generation in 2019 was very strong, despite the $828 million operating income reduction due to the MAX groundings. During 2019, we generated $4 billion in operating cash flow and a record $3.4 billion in free cash flow, with $2 billion of share repurchases and $372 million in dividends. We have $1.35 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization, net of the $550 million accelerated share repurchase currently under way, that is expected to wrap up no later than mid-February. We have very healthy cash and liquidity, low leverage, manageable debt obligations this year and remain focused on a balanced approach to investing in our employees and the Company and returning cash and value to our shareholders. In closing, I'd like to extend another huge thank you to all of our employees. Taking into consideration the significant impact the MAX grounding had on our operational and financial performance, our 2019 results were truly superb. We did not lose ground on our very strong financial position, maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet, ample liquidity, strong cash flows and healthy shareholder returns. And we also continue investing in our business and we're well positioned for the future. Absent the impact of the MAX groundings and first quarter 2019 unique items, we achieved our unit revenue growth goal of greater than 3% for 2019. Likewise, we beat our unit cost guidance for 2019, which is just tremendous. Of course, the MAX did significantly impact 2019 and 2020 will also be significantly impacted by the ongoing MAX situation, but our focus on solid execution remains unchanged. We look forward to getting past these near-term challenges and temporary headwinds, safely returning the MAX to commercial service and leveraging our low cost and robust route network to resume our growth. So, with that, Chad, we are ready to take analyst questions. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/01/23/southwest-airlines-co-luv-q4-2019-earnings-call-tr.aspx
Southwest Airlines Co (LUV) Q3 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 24, 2019","Thanks, Ryan. And thank you all for joining us for our third quarter 2019 earnings call. All around, it was an outstanding performance and I am prouder than ever of our people. We told you last quarter, we were going to adjust to the MAX and operate a great airline and our people did just that. Our customer feedback reflects that. It was just a great performance in terms of reliability and hospitality. So I'm very, very proud and very thankful for our people. We also told you we would adjust for the MAX and produced satisfactory financial results, and I think we under promised. These results are stellar, strong revenues, better cost performance, record earnings, EPS was up 13.9% and even without the $31 million tax benefit, EPS would have been up over 9%. And of course, our EPS would have been up over 43% were it not for the MAX grounding. Our operations frontline employees have delivered exceptionally well. I'm going to also give another special shout out to our planners or as I've turned in last time, our replanners who continue to toil through ever changing scenarios and that is network planning, operations planning, financial planning, just to name a few. They continue to work very long hours and produce amazing results, that's just truly heroic. I talk a lot about the importance of being prepared for the unexpected as heard -- taught [Phonetic] me and really all of us to do. And we talk about the importance of low cost, ample cash, low debt levels, sensible growth, sensible capital commitments. But we can never talk too much about the importance of having great and talented employees and a very strong culture. And of course an element of that culture, we call the warrior spirit and their resilience. So we are truly blessed to have such great people. I want to talk about what's next. In addition to continuing to run a superb airline operation and deliver solid financial results, we want to do a couple of things. We want to conclude our discussions with the Boeing Company regarding compensation for the MAX related damages. And secondly, we want to safely and methodically return the MAX to service. And regarding the timeline of that, the FAA has revealed this week, that they receive the final software and related system documentation for the MAX from Boeing and they are in the process of certifying the changes with the certification flight weeks away, while the FAA has been very clear and very careful not to commit to a date working with Boeing, we've assumed an ungrounding date of around mid-December, and that translates to a MAX in-service date for us of February the 8th, in terms of our flight schedule. So along the way between now and mid December if we judge that, that date won't be met, we will grow [Phonetic] our schedule yet again. So recall that our second quarter assumption was that Boeing delivered by the end of September, so we're about three to four weeks behind that, which is why we've moved from what was the January 6th date to February, the 8th. So the closer we get, the more confident I am. However, I'm still not highly confident about mid-December. I think Ryan has already made that clear. But what's important of course is that we give the FAA the time that they need to do their job, which I know they will. And of course, we're here to support them every way that we can. Our plans and our outlook for the fourth quarter are very solid. We've got a schedule that's stable, if not optimal. Travel demand continues to be strong. Fuel prices are remarkably stable and moderate, and our cost outlook for everything else is below our original plan. So we've given you the guidepost for fourth quarter in the press release and the key to understand here is that we had to redo what turns out to be nine complex schedules that make up the fourth quarter and they're complex, because of the wide variability caused by the holidays. And we simply didn't have time to redo nine schedules. So we did one or in essence one and that results, and less peak flying than we would otherwise like, because we didn't have enough airplanes and translates into more non-peak flying, then we would like. So time has gone by since we've done that. Bookings look pretty darn good for the fourth quarter and we're more bullish that RASM will be up during the quarter and we've provided that guidance and maybe as much as 2%. And that's on capacity that is down just slightly versus a year ago. Regarding next year, we are redoing our plan yet again as we speak. I don't have a capacity forecast for you for the obvious reason other than to say I can't imagine that it will be double-digit growth compared to 2019. And I would also say that more than likely, whatever you guessed it would be based on our July discussions. It's going to be less than that, because the return to service schedule has pushed out. So our 2020 market priorities will continue to be Hawaii, which is going extremely well and based on what we published so far, we'll have an emphasis on Denver, Baltimore and Houston. And obviously, looking forward to having the MAX back, so we can restore a lot of depth that is currently missing in a lot of our markets. So Mike, Tom and Tammy as always are going to elaborate further, those are the highlights. And with that I'm going to turn it over to our Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Mike Van de Ven to kick this off. Mike? ","Thank you, Tom and my thanks to everyone for joining us today. We had another solid quarter of earnings and EPS growth, along with margin expansion, which is notable considering the extraordinary challenges resulting from the grounding of the MAX. I'm very grateful for the incredible resiliency and hard work of our employees and extremely proud of how our Southwest family rally together to produce strong results despite an unanticipated 6 point to 6.5 point reduction in our capacity this year due to the MAX. Gary, Mike and Tom outlined most of the challenging -- the challenges we're managing through. So I will round out our remarks with commentary on our cost performance, fleet and capacity plans, and balance sheet and cash flow, including the related MAX impact. Turning first to our non-fuel cost performance. The largest driver of the 7.6% year-over-year increase and our third quarter CASM excluding fuel and profit sharing or CASM-Ex was an estimated 6 point to 7 point impact from the MAX groundings and resulting flight cancellations. Our third quarter year-over-year capacity growth was approximately 8 points lower versus our plan which will also be the case in fourth quarter. Excluding the MAX related unit cost pressure, the remaining modest year-over-year increase was driven largely by increases in salary, wages and benefits, as well as maintenance expense. While these cost pressures were anticipated, we did come in favorable to our latest guidance of 8% to 10%. In addition to good cost control across the Board, we saw cost efficiencies and labor cost related to the strong operational and on-time performance that Mike covered earlier. We also received some favorable airport settlements during third quarter as well as lower than expected airport rate increases. Overall, I'd like to commend our employees for executing our cost plan to keep us on target this year, excluding the significant year-over-year unit cost pressure from MAX related flight cancellations. We started the year expecting fourth quarter 2019 CASM-Ex to decrease around 2% year-over-year. We've had about 1 point of year-over-year CASM-Ex shifting from earlier periods into fourth quarter, and we are expecting a fourth quarter unit cost penalty from the MAX groundings to be approximately 6 point. Therefore, we now expect our fourth quarter 2019 CASM-Ex to increase in the 4% to 6% range year-over-year. The key drivers year-over-year are increases in salary wages and benefits, maintenance expense and airport cost. It is worth noting that we have taken actions this year to mitigate what impact we could including on the cost side. As I said previously, our fourth quarter capacity is about 8 points lower than it would have been absent the MAX groundings. However, we expect that we will be able to offset about 2 points to 3 points of unit cost inflation due to the benefits from higher off-peak flying in fourth quarter which nets us to our 6 point penalty. We will continue to focus on these areas to less than the unit cost penalties, but despite our best efforts, the impact to our overall unit cost inflation in fourth quarter continues to be significant. Looking at our full-year non-fuel costs, we currently expect CASM-Ex to increase approximately 8% year-over-year. With some unit cost mitigation of fourth quarter the MAX groundings are now expected to drive 5 points of year-over-year inflation to full year 2019, slightly better than we previously estimated. And again, our employees have done an incredible job executing on our plan to control cost pressures. Excluding the impact of the MAX groundings to our 2019 costs, our core year-over-year unit cost performance is in line with our original plan to keep CASM-Ex inflation to 3% to 3.5% for 2019. And that includes factoring and the incremental $10 million of maintenance expense to keep seven of the 737-700 aircraft that we were going to retire as well as the $42 million bonus for our mechanics. Both of which occurred after our initial 3 point to 3.5 point unit cost guide back in January. A quick note, on first quarter 2020. We expect continued year-over-year unit cost inflation due to the level of fixed cost we carry regardless of the depressed capacity from the MAX grounding, currently out to February 8th, 2020. And as we gradually ramp back up, in addition, we estimate incremental return to service cost in the tens of [Phonetic] millions next year. Moving on to fuel, our third quarter fuel price was $2.07 per gallon near the lower end of our guidance range. Market energy prices spiked following the Saudi Arabia oil attacks around the time of our mid-September 8-K update and then moderated in the second half of September. The recent volatility in the energy markets served as a reminder of the importance of having meaningful insurance with our fuel hedge program. We are approximately 65% hedged for fourth quarter 2019; for 2020, we are nearly 60% hedged; for 2021, we are around 50%; and we have been adding to our 2022 hedging positions, putting us at around 25% protection. For fourth quarter 2019 based on market prices, as of October 18th, we expect our fuel price to again being in the range of $2.05 to $2.15 per gallon. The fourth quarter crude oil forward curve is slightly lower than third quarter, but fourth quarter heating oil cracks are currently estimated to increase around 20% sequentially. Our fuel efficiency continues to be significantly impacted by the MAX grounding. We came into 2019 expecting a solid year-over-year improvement and fuel efficiency, largely driven by the operating performance of the MAX aircraft, which is expected to produce 20% fuel burn improvement over our retired classic fleet and a 14% improvement over our next generation, our NG fleet. Third quarter ASMs per gallon declined 0.9% year-over-year and fourth quarter ASMs per gallon are also expected to decline year-over-year in the range of down 1% to 2%. Once the MAX returns to service, we expect to reverse this trend and get back on track with our fuel efficiency improvement goal. Wrapping up the income statement, as you read in the highlights of our press release, we did record a $31 million reduction to income tax expense late in the quarter which related to a clarification of regulations that allowed an increase to the amount of tax bonus depreciation relating to our 27% [Phonetic] tax return, when the rate was 35%. This represented $0.05 per share that was not factored into our previous guidance. Even excluding the tax adjustment for the quarter was a solid feet to expectations. Now turning to fleet and capacity. We have not taken delivery of any aircraft since the MAX groundings in mid-March, we retired 737 aircraft during the third quarter and the quarter with 752 total aircraft. We haven't officially updated our contractual delivery schedule with Boeing at this point, which continues to 44 total MAX deliveries this year with 41 remaining as of the mid-March grounding. Based on Boeing's targeted regulatory approval of MAX return to service in fourth quarter 2019, Boeing has proposed to revised MAX delivery schedule that has us receiving seven MAX aircraft during fourth quarter 2019. That would result in the remaining 34 MAX deliveries shifting out of 2019 and into 2020. We continue to expect to retire 10 more 737-700s this year for a total of 11 versus our original retirement plan of '18. We postpone the retirement of seven of our owned -700s to help with our 2019 aircraft deficit. Assuming seven aircraft deliveries in fourth quarter 2019 and netting out our 11 retirements, this year we expect to end 2019 with the total fleet of 749 aircraft. For 2020 based on Boeing's targeted return to service timeline, we expect to be back on our aircraft delivery schedule around mid-2020. This would result in 72 MAX deliveries in 2020 and we currently expect to retire 20 to 25 of our 737-700 aircraft next year resulting in a total fleet of approximately 800 aircraft by year-end 2020. Our third quarter available seat miles declined 2.9% year-over-year. For fourth quarter 2019, we expect our capacity to decline in the range of 0.5% to 1%, which would put our full year 2019 capacity down approximately 1.5% year-over-year. With ongoing uncertainty of the MAX return to service date, we are not ready to provide annual 2020 capacity guidance at this point. We have published flight schedules through April 13th of 2020, which includes the removal of the MAX through February, the 8th. And based on those published schedules we currently expect first quarter 2020 capacity to increase in the 2% to 3% range year-over-year. Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with very healthy cash and short-term investments of approximately $4 billion. Our cash balance is higher than usual as we haven't been making aircraft delivery payments since a mid-March. Due to a lower number of expected aircraft deliveries in fourth quarter 2019, we now expect our 2019 capex to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion with aircraft related capex of approximately $300 million. Our 2019 aircraft capex is down approximately $700 million from our original capex plan which will shift to 2020 assuming our aircraft delivery delays are caught up next year. As a result of the MAX groundings we've incurred $435 million operating income penalty year-to-date. Still, our cash flow generation has been very strong. For the first nine months of 2019, we generated $3.2 billion in operating cash flow and $2.4 billion in free cash flow with $1.45 billion of share repurchases and $372 million in dividends. Our current $500 million accelerated share repurchase program wraps up next week and we have $1.9 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. In closing, I'd like to extend another huge thank you to all of our employees. Despite the significant impact from the MAX groundings on our operations and financial results, we generated record operating revenues, record RASM and record net income and earnings per share in third quarter. Our margins and returns on capital were solid considering a 2 point, 3 point impact to each from the MAX groundings. Absent the impact, we would have expanded margins even further and grown returns in third quarter, year-over-year. Our balance sheet and cash flows remained very strong and we continue to provide meaningful returns to shareholders. Overall, I am pleased with our strong financial results this quarter and I'm very happy with the execution this year, especially considering the $435 million year-to-date operating income penalty for the MAX grounding and resulting flight cancellations. Excluding the MAX impacts thus far on a unit basis, we remain on track to achieve our unit revenue and unit cost goal for this year. This is simply outstanding and a true testament to the unwavering fortitude and treatment [Phonetic] of our Southwest family. All in all, we have a lot to be proud of and we are eager to get the MAX back in service and resume our growth once the FAA deems to do so. With that, Chad, I'll turn it back to you now to take analyst questions. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/24/southwest-airlines-co-luv-q3-2019-earnings-call-tr.aspx
Southwest Airlines Co (LUV) Q2 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 25, 2019","Thank you, Ryan. And thanks everybody for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. This year turned out to be quite a wild ride. We had some subplots earlier in the year, but the story is overwhelmed by the MAX grounding. The good news is we were exceptionally well prepared for the unexpected. We are healthier than ever and that's despite the body blow from the MAX, and we'll get through it, and we will get back on track.The frustrating thing since our last call is that the MAX grounding has extended much longer than we had anticipated. Of course that's no surprise now given that this news was revealed last month. Boeing won't have the latest software fix done until September. And in the meantime, we will be operating a great airline and produce very strong financial results all without any amounts from a Boeing settlement. Our people have done a heroic job, and I don't use that word lightly. And not only are they resilient, they're tough, they are brilliant, they are compassionate, and I want to thank them for a job well done. Our frontline employees have truly risen to the occasion dealing with 20,000 flight cancellations. But you don't hear a lot about our back office folks and we have numerous unsung heroes, so I want to sing for them. The frontline is at a hard time they certainly have a hard time completing their mission without a plan.And our planners that, I'm going to have to rename re-planners have done an amazing job and I would lead that off with network planning, our operations planning, our financial planning groups, just to name a few. They have worked grueling hours, they have improvised, and they have really, really delivered. And I'm very proud of everybody. While the financial results are remarkably strong, strong margins, strong cash flow, revenues, and a really good cost performance, there's a lot of news in the press release. You're going to get a lot of excellent insights from Mike, Tom and Tammy, but I would like to point out just a few things.Number one, it's really all about the MAX. That's the only issue that we are dealing with and of course, it's helpful just to have one thing to be able to focus on. So everything else within the company is rock solid. Secondly, business is strong. Second quarter came in as expected. We had strong RASM. Third quarter is forecasted up 3% to 5%, which is right where it should be relative to second quarter.Thirdly, our cost management is solid. Taking into account the MAX and the out-of-service aircraft we are where we expect to be, if not better for the second third and quarters and in the full year. We told you all at the beginning of the year that we were looking at flat CASM-Ex in the second half and that's where we think we will be taking again the MAX into account. Fourthly, Newark, any student of Southwest will quickly understand our approach here and this is a tactical decision forced by the MAX groundings and the painful cut of 8% of our capacity. As a little bit of background, we acquired 18 Newark slot pairs in 2010 and that was a consequence of the United Continental merger where they were required to divest some slots. So we did that deal in about 24 hours.At that time, we had virtually no presence at LaGuardia, and in fact had only been there for about a year. On the LaGuardia side of things in 2011, we acquired more slots at LaGuardia with our AirTran acquisition. In 2013, we acquired yet again more slots from the divestiture caused by the U.S. Airways and American merger. So we find ourselves with a significantly larger presence at LaGuardia than we had contemplated back in 2010 when we went into Newark. We also find ourselves in a magnificent facility, which is certainly significantly better than what we started with in 2009. So, we currently offer 37 daily departures from LaGuardia that will be as of October. New York is a huge market, but for us it is a destination market. Given our relatively small position at Newark and LaGuardia, and our inability to add any meaningful number of flights to these market, it makes sense for us to consolidate our New York City flying into one airport.LaGuardia is the choice for the vast majority of our New York City bound customers. And it's not out of character for us. We consolidated our operations in a couple of Ohio locations in 2017. We consolidated Flint Michigan into Detroit in 2018. And then with larger markets like Chicago, Houston, Dallas, we served one airport. Newark underperforms financially, and to offset our reduction in service there we'll be able to add seats at LaGuardia, and be more productive with a superior financial result. So that's what's happening with Newark. The other thing, I could add is that as to the timing, it's very straightforward. We need the airplanes. We can't afford in this highly competitive environment where our capacity overall is cut to have underperforming assets, which leads to my fifth point, which is Hawaii. We'll be resuming our expansion without having to wait on the MAX any further and as we described in the press release. Adding Hawaii and quickly becoming relevant is strategic for us, and this move better supports execution of that strategy.So to be clear, we aren't backing off of New York City with this move, but we are accelerating our growth in California and Hawaii.So those are the high points. And to kick us off with more details and better insights, I'm going to turn the call over to first, our Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Mike Van de Ven. ","Thank you, Tom and hello everyone. Thank you for joining us today and I'd like to add my thanks to all of our terrific employees for their focus and hard work. Our people are simply the best, and they have proven that time and time again.Gary, Mike and Tom have outlined the challenges that we've been managing through with the MAX groundings and I will round out our remarks with some commentary on the MAX impact on our cost, fleet and capacity plans and our balance sheet and cash flow.Starting with cost. I'd like to commend our people for a great job at managing cost in a challenging quarter. Our second quarter nominal cost, excluding fuel and profit sharing, came in a little better than we expected at the beginning of the quarter.On a unit basis, ex-fuel special items and profit sharing, our cost increased 10.9% year-over-year. The impact of the MAX groundings drove six points of this year-over-year increase with the remainder of the increase primarily related to planned increases in salary wages and benefits, maintenance spend, and airport cost. Our second quarter CASM-Ex increase was favorable to the guidance we provided in our June investor update when we were expecting a year-over-year increase in the 11.5% to 12.5% range. Following our investor update, the combination of the grounded MAX aircraft and weather resulted in a lower completion factor than expected which drove ASMs down further. However, the incremental unit cost pressure was more than offset by lower-than-expected airport cost, shifting of advertising and maintenance expenses to future quarters, and solid cost controls. Turning to third quarter. The year-over-year unit cost pressure due to the MAX groundings continued. We started the year expecting about two points of inflation in CASM-Ex in third quarter 2019. We now expect seven points of the year-over-year CASM-Ex impact from the groundings in this quarter compared with the previously communicated three-point impact I mentioned on our April earnings call, when we had the MAX aircraft removed from our flight scheduled through August 5. When combined with about a one point increase in year-over-year CASM-Ex from cost shifting from first half 2019, we now expect our third quarter 2019 CASM-Ex to increase in the 9% to 11% range year-over-year. Sans shifting and the MAX impact, our third quarter CASM-Ex is relatively in line with our cost plan at the beginning of the year.The good news is that we have gained some non-fuel cost offsets for third quarter, as our flight schedule changes were well in advance of our flight crew bidding process and we also had temporarily lowered landing fees. As Mike mentioned, we've also temporarily delayed some flight crew hiring. These offsets pale in comparison to the year-over-year unit cost penalty, but we are doing what we can to mitigate near-term pressure and we will continue to do so.Looking at the full year, our current guidance is based on MAX cancellations through January 5. The MAX groundings are driving an incremental six points to full year CASM-Ex year-over-year as we are six to seven points off our original capacity growth plan to grow 2019 ASMs nearly 5%. Therefore, we currently estimate annual 2019 CASM-Ex to increase in the 8% to 10% range year-over-year.As a reminder, our annual CASM-Ex increase also includes the previously communicated 0.5 point increase year-over-year from cost related to the ratified agreement with our mechanics and approximately $10 million of incremental maintenance expense for seven of our 737-700 aircraft that we have decided to keep instead of retire this year, which I'll cover in a moment. I won't spend too much time on fuel as the market held fairly steady through second quarter. Our second quarter economic fuel price was right around the mid-point of our most recent guidance at $2.13 per gallon which included hedging gains per gallon of $0.06 and premium expense per gallon of $0.05.We have a great fuel hedging protection in place this year, with about a 65% hedge in both third and fourth quarters. Our hedging premiums for this year remain at approximately $95 million or about $0.05 per gallon, and we have a 58% hedge position for 2020. So, we are well prepared.For third quarter 2019 based on market prices as of July 19 and given our current hedge, we expect our fuel price per gallon to fall in the $2.05 to $2.15 range. As I mentioned last quarter, our fuel efficiency has been significantly impacted by the MAX grounding. Second quarter ASMs per gallon declined 1.7% year-over-year and third quarter ASMs per gallon are also expected to decline year-over-year in the 1% to 2% range.This decline highlights the fuel efficiency of the MAX which is about 14% better than the 737 NG fleet. Once the MAX returns to service, we expect to get back on track with our desired fuel efficiency gains. Turning to fleet and capacity. We have not taken delivery of any aircraft since the MAX groundings in mid-March and we didn't retire any aircraft this quarter. So we started and ended the quarter with 753 airplanes. We don't have an update to our contractual delivery schedule with Boeing at this point, which shows 41 remaining deliveries this year. But we expect the majority of these will shift to 2020.We have been working through the delivery delays with Boeing. Based on their guidance, we are currently assuming, we will get 16 aircraft deliveries during fourth quarter 2019 which includes seven leased aircraft. To help mitigate the impact of the delivery delays, we are postponing the retirement of seven of our own -700s. With this in mind, we now expect to retire 11 -700s this year versus original retirement plan of 18. Turning back to second quarter, our ASMs declined 3.6% year-over-year. For third quarter, given the absence of the MAX aircraft for the entire quarter, we expect capacity to be down in the 2% to 3% range year-over-year. With the extension of the MAX cancellations through year-end, fourth quarter 2019 capacity is expected to be flat to down 1% year-over-year.So looking at our second half 2019 plans versus where we are now, the impact of the groundings is far greater in the back half of the year and, of course, that's a function of the growing number of MAX aircraft we had planned to have in our fleet. For full year 2019, we now estimate capacity to be down in the 1% to 2% range year-over-year. And finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with very healthy cash and short-term investments of approximately $4 billion. We originally estimated our total 2019 capex spend would be in the $1.9 billion to $2 billion range, with approximately $1 billion in aircraft-related spend.Based on Boeing's most recent guidance for our remaining deliveries this year, we now expect total 2019 capexto be in the $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion range with aircraft-related capexto be in the $400 million to $500 million range. The $500 million to $600 million reduction in this year's aircraft capexwill shift to 2020, assuming the deliveries delays are caught up next year. Despite the year-to-date operating income penalty of $225 million from the MAX groundings, $175 million of which was in the second quarter, we generated strong operating cash flows in the first half of the year of $2.1 billion, with free cash flow of $1.7 billion, allowing us to return $1.2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.In closing, I'd like to extend another huge thank you to all of our employees who are managing through all the challenges the MAX groundings have presented. I am tremendously pleased with our financial results this quarter. Despite the negative financial impacts and operational challenges from the MAX groundings and the 20,000 canceled flights, we still managed to produce strong margins and all-time high quarterly revenues, load factors and earnings per diluted share. Our pre-tax return on invested capital was a strong 23.4% even with a 1 to 2 point year-to-date penalty from the MAX grounding. Our balance sheet and cash flows remained strong, allowing us to continue to provide meaningful shareholder return.Our revenue production is strong and we continue to benefit significantly from our new revenue management system our Rapid Rewards program and ancillary revenues. We have a great fuel hedging protection in place in 2019 and beyond to mitigate fuel price pressure. While lower capacity is putting year-over-year pressure on our non-fuel unit costs, we remain diligent on controlling the cost we can. Based on what we know today, we continue to expect solid margins in 2019 at or near industry-leading FX, even with the MAX penalty, with the opportunity to continue delivering stellar returns on capital. We will get past our near-term challenges from the MAX groundings and our second quarter 2019 financial results demonstrate the strength of our low-cost business model, our network and our amazing people. With that, Greg, I'll turn it back to you now to take questions. Thank you. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/25/southwest-airlines-co-luv-q2-2019-earnings-call-tr.aspx
Southwest Airlines Co (LUV) Q1 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"April 25, 2019","Thanks you, Ryan, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our first quarter 2019 earnings call. Overall, I'm as proud as I have ever been of our people, they did an extraordinary job, produced solid results among industry leading margins, and despite the challenges of near record cancellations. And but for the numerous cancellation events, it would have been a blowout quarter, but still rock solid margins, returns and cash flows and a huge thank you to our people for their resilience and for their perseverance. Based on where we are today and what we can see from today, the second quarter will be better. We are better prepared to handle the MAX schedule changes prospectively through August 5th, rather than the more chaotic daily cancellations. And our goal is to provide our customers a steller experience during the busy summer especially our on time performance was solid in the first quarter, and it will be solid again here in the second quarter. Restoring the MAX to service as soon as it's ready is also a priority, of course, and assuming that happens within the next couple of months, we'll get back on our delivery schedule and our capacity plans. Mike, Tom and Tammy have prepared excellent briefings on our operations, commercial and financial performances and expectations, and I don't want to steal their thunder, so I'm going to be brief this morning, but I did want to reiterate a couple of points. Despite the challenging year so far, first of all, we were once again named the fortunes list of the world's most admired companies, this year ranked Number 11. We were just ranked Number 2, out of 500 companies on the Forbes' List of Best Employers. And all great companies start and end with having great people and being a great employer. So we're very proud of that. We were Number 1 in the DOT rankings for 2018, customer satisfaction again, and we're off to a great start in 2019. Our brand and NPS scores remained strong in 2019 and industry leading as well. We have a balance sheet leverage of less than 28%. We have almost $3.9 billion in cash. We have an excellent cost effective and risk off fuel hedge in place for the next several years. Our Hawaii expansion is off to an exceptional start and of course that is despite having numerous distractions in the first quarter. Our technology plans for this year and next are ambitious, but they are proceeding well and on track. And then finally, I expect us to make progress on our cost initiatives this year, except for the capacity cuts effect of course. And we're not giving up on our goal to expand margins and return on capital year-over-year. Despite the challenges, we may very well set records in some financial categories this year. But having said that, I admit that there is uncertainty surrounding a lot of things, certainly the timing of the MAX and as usual, the economy and fuel prices. But we're off to a good start and we're planning on having a good year and making a lot of progress this year. So with that, very quick overview overview, let me turn it over to our Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Michael Van de Ven. Mike? ","Thank you, Tom, and hello everyone. Gary, Mike and Tom have outlined the challenges that we've been managing through since the beginning of the year. And I'd like to add my thanks to all of our hard working employees for their resilient focus to take good care of our customers and for their unwavering commitment to Southwest. Despite this significant headwind, we are off to a solid start to the year with almost a 10% pre-tax margin, and we continue to consistently generate strong cash flows and shareholder returns. I want to also thank our people for their focus on cost control in the midst of all the challenges. Our first quarter nominal cost, excluding fuel and profit sharing, were relatively in line with where we expected them to be at the beginning of the quarter, despite the numerous headwinds. On a unit basis ex-fuel, special items, and profit sharing, our cost increased 8.1% year-over-year. Relative to the approximately 6% we were expecting back in January, there were two primary drivers of the higher year-over-year growth. First, the flight cancellations we experienced reduced our available seat mile growth in first quarter by about 2.5 point year-over-year. And combined with additional cost pressures from maintenance related disruptions and whether increased our CASM-Ex by about 3 points since we didn't have opportunities to shed cost that predominantly fixed at close-in Second, we had a $30 million increase to salary wages and benefits due to our tentative agreement with AMFA which represent a higher compensation for our mechanics compared with the previously rejected DA from last fall. This created another point of year-over-year CASM-Ex increase in first quarter. This 4 point negative CASM-Ex-impact was offset by about 2 point due to better than expected completion factor, employee productivity and healthcare trends as well as the shifting of advertising and airport costs out of first quarter and into future quarters this year. This resulted in an 8.1% increase and our first quarter CASM, excluding fuel, special items, and profit sharing, year-over-year. So to recap, if you exclude the impacts from the unexpected events, first quarter 2019 CASM-Ex growth would have been in the 4% to 5% range year-over-year. Looking to second quarter, our expectations back in January were for year-over-year cost inflation, ex-fuel and profit sharing and the 6% range similar to our initial first quarter estimate. As a reminder, the key drivers of our initial expectation worthy under-utilization of our fleet and first half of 2019 due to the delay in our service to Hawaii, and the resulting one time start-up cost, higher airport, labor and ownership cost, as well as the timing of maintenance events and technology investments. While those drivers are still relevant, the reduced capacity from MAX grounding for second quarter is now driving an additional 5 points of inflationary pressure, net of some flight crew and landing fee efficiencies from proactive flight cancellations beginning in early April. First is our immediate cancellations in March. And we have about 1.5 point negative impact from advertising and airport cost shifting from first quarter. As a result, we now expect second quarter CASM excluding fuel and profit sharing to increase in the 10.5% to 12.5% range year-over-year. Looking to the back half of this year, we initially expected flat CASM-Ex, with our MAX grounding extended through August 5th, we now estimate about 3 points of incremental unit cost pressure in third quarter 2019 based on flight cancellations to date. And while we hope this doesn't persist sending longer, there is still uncertainty around the timing of the MAX returning to service. That said, based on what we know today, we continue to expect sequential improvement in the year-over-year CASM-Ex fuel and profit sharing from second to third to fourth quarter. For our full year 2019 cost under the assumption that MAX grounding do not extend beyond August 5th. We currently estimate CASM excluding fuel and profit sharing will increase and the 5.5% to 6.5% range year-over-year. This includes about a 2 point headwind from lower capacity as a result of the MAX grounding and 0.5 point of headwind due to DA with AMFA. Of course, I will keep you updated as we learn more. Moving on to fuel, fuel prices have increased since the beginning of the year with bank Brent crude at 25% and first quarter since January 1. Also our fuel efficiency improvement has been impacted by the MAX grounding. That said, our first quarter economic fuel price was in line with our most recent guidance at $2.05 per gallon. We have great fuel hedging protection in place this year with 78% hedge in second quarter and 60% to 65% hedged and the second half of the year. Our hedging premiums for this year remains at approximately $95 million or about $0.04 per gallon. Our 2019 hedging protection producers modest gains at current market prices, and kicks in more materially at a 75 Brent crude equivalent, so we are very well prepared, should we, should we continue to see rising energy prices. And as a reminder, our 2019 hedges are WTI and Brent crude. Our hedging portfolio continues to be structured so that we fully participate in any market decline. For second quarter 2019 and full year 2019 based on market prices as of April 18 and given our current hedge, we expect our fuel price per gallon to be in the $2.10 to $2.20 range. Fuel efficiency improved a modest 0.5% in first quarter, which was understandably lower than expected, but the grounding of our 34 most fuel-efficient MAX aircraft in mid-March. Also, heavy winter weather also drove a higher fuel consumption than we have planned. Second quarter fuel efficiency is expected to be flat to down 1% year-over-year as the MAX has been removed from the entire second quarter flight schedule. For the full year 2019 fuel efficiency is now expected to be flat to up 1% year-over-year. That said, fuel efficiency improvement remains a material part of our longer-term cost story, once the MAX's back in service and more fuel-efficient aircraft will comprise a growing percentage of our total fleet. Turning now to our industry-leading balance sheet, our strong financial position (inaudible) and upgrade to A- from Fitch during the quarter, which we are thrilled about. We ended the quarter with ample cash and short-term investments of $3.9 billion, with our $1 billion revolver fully available. We adopted the new lease standard as of January 1st, 2019 on a prospective basis. And as a result, the primary impact was to the balance sheet. We recognized a $1.5 billion operating lease right of use assets, which is primarily comprised of aircraft operating leases and airport operating leases, and a corresponding liability. We also removed $1.7 billion of assets constructive for others and the related construction obligation of $1.6 billion for completed Airport Terminal projects, such as Dallas Love Field, Houston Hobby in Fort Lauderdale . The net impact was approximately $270 million reduction to the balance sheet. The impact to the income statement was immaterial. We have very manageable debt obligations capital spending plans for 2019. And at this point, we continue to expect 2019 CapEx in the $1.9 billion to $2 billion range based on the remaining Boeing delivery schedule for this year. Our non-aircraft CapEx, we continue to make significant investments in technology and we are making good progress on a new maintenance system. Our significant airport investments in LAX, Kansas City, Baltimore, Nashville and Boston are under way, and progress is being made on our maintenance hangar investments in Houston, Phoenix and Denver. We expect our investments to help drive incremental revenue and productivity as well as support longer term cost objectives and our growth plans. We had strong cash flows in first quarter allowing us to return $678 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Lastly, on fleet and capacity, we ended first quarter with 753 aircraft in our fleet, taking delivery of three leased MAX 8 aircraft so far this year. We are currently working through the delivery delays with Boeing, but we don't have any updates to share at this point. Although, our 41 remaining aircraft deliveries this year are on hold, the majority of them are back half loaded. As a reminder, we have 28 owned MAX aircraft from Boeing and 13 additional leased MAX aircraft in our order book for 2019. We are evaluating our fleet retirement plans, but at this point, we continue to expect to retire as many as 18 aircraft this year, but that will obviously be subject to the duration of the MAX groundings. Our retirements help with our fleet modernization efforts, improving efficiency, reliability, fuel burn, and reducing our maintenance burden. In second quarter, our given MAX flight cancellations we now expect capacity to be down in the 2% to 3% range year-over-year. And for full year 2019, based on what we know today and given MAX flight cancellations through August 5th, we now estimate our annual 2019 capacity will increase in the 2% to 3% range year-over-year. Our schedule is currently published through early November and that includes the first phase of our Hawaii plan as Tom covered. And we'll will evaluate further flight schedule revisions based on the duration of the MAX grounding. So in closing, and as a quick recap on what we share today, despite the ongoing MAX groundings, our employees continue to rally and take great care of our customers. Our revenue management system is producing revenue gains and performing exactly as we expected to, and we are expecting strong year-over-year RASM growth in second quarter. We have a great fuel hedging protection for 2019 and beyond in place to mitigate rising fuel prices. Flight cancellations and lower capacity is putting pressure on our non-fuel unit costs, but we continue to focus on strict cost control and being nimble. Based on what we know today, we continue to expect solid margins in 2019 with the opportunity to deliver stellar returns on capital. We continue to make important investments in our people, our fleet, the airports we serve, and technology, which will support our scalability and many future growth opportunities including Hawaii. Another huge thank you to all of our employees who are managing through a lot and continue to do a terrific job. With that, Cody, I'll turn it back to you now to take questions.

Southwest Airlines Co (LUV) Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call Transcript,"Oct. 25, 2018","Thank you, Ryan, and good morning everybody, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. First of all, I want to thank all of our employees for an excellent third quarter performance. It was a very nice recovery from the second quarter, which was down 3% on a RASM basis, due to Flight 1380 and then that was a nice turnaround to the third quarter RASM performance of 1 -- up 1.2%. Mexico was weak for us in terms of revenue, but our domestic performance, excluding all the international, the domestic performance was a solid RASM of plus 2.3% year-over-year and it's 2.9% if you adjust for stage and gauge increases. Overall, we had a sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement of 2 percentage points ahead of normal trends. So again, it was very nice recovery. Our year-over-year comps always have noise in them, but I'm expecting another sequential trend improvement in fourth quarter, and then a year-over-year improvement as we said in the press release of 1% to 2%. So again that would be another nice -- better than trend as sequential improvement if we do that. Our unit cost ex times will come in roughly flat to up 1% for the year end -- for the fourth quarter for that matter, but another excellent cost performance. We wanted to provide you an early look ahead to 2019. Our confidence level of forecasting revenues is never 100%, of course, and especially looking a year out, but our goal for next year right now is positive RASM and of at least 3%. And while it is a goal, trends and initiatives that we already have under way will support that goal. Our confidence level in predicting cost is much higher of course than revenues, and based on the planning that's currently under way, the preliminary read is that unit costs ex items will also be up at least 3%. I'm not satisfied with that, as I'm sure our investors are either and Tammy will describe the cost pressures further, but I did want to provide some perspective first. Just looking across the last decade plus, we've committed to strategic initiatives and invested accordingly. Some investments were revenue generating, some investments were capacity and growth related, some investments were efficiency related, but as a consequence of that strategy and those investments, the airline has been transformed, and the cost during this intervening time period have been well controlled. And to do that, we relied primarily on fleet modernization to accomplish that. We have a stronger, much more prosperous, but a more complex airline. In some cases, there are costs associated with driving these higher revenues, but the main point that I want to make is that our focus with our strategic efforts has clearly been on transforming the airline and driving more revenue along with operational reliability and customer service. And I'm very pleased with the results of all those efforts. The results must be sustained and continuously improved from here. But eventually, I think, all of us at Southwest knew that the time would come where our initiatives would need to zero in on efficiency and productivity and just overall cost control, and clearly that time has arrived and cost will be our number one priority. So the basic inflationary themes that Tammy is going to talk about we constantly battle. We're investing in airport infrastructure, we're investing in technology, initiatives and projects. Aircraft maintenance is an ever increasing burden, and then there is just natural salaries, wages and benefits inflation. So the opportunities to offset that natural inflation are what you would expect that lie in the horizon -- modernizing our fleet, just the overall quality of our flight schedule continuing to drive operational efficiency, controlling our G&A spending, and then -- from there of course, we just rely on the individual department missions. So for 2019, at this preliminary juncture, while we're seeing the known cost pressures, we aren't yet seeing the productivity offsets. There are offsets in fuel, because of fuel efficiency, which of course are showing up in the cost ex-fuel items, but we're not seeing enough productivity offsets yet. So speaking plainly, it will take more focus on our part and more effort on our part to make that happen. And as I've already said, that's where our focus will be and we may have to deprioritize some other yearn-for things that we have in the meantime. I'll also point out that many of our efficiencies are already under way that will -- again, will show up in jet fuel consumption, and we'll need to clearly identify that for you as offsets in the future. So we have a challenge and we always do by the way. We always have challenges. We're very well-prepared and very well positioned. Number one, we have a very strong balance sheet with declining leverage and it's below 30%. We have very strong liquidity with cash levels well ahead of our target. We just reported record earnings for the quarter and barring the unforeseen, we expect very strong year-over-year earnings growth in the fourth quarter. We have an outstanding fuel hedge that's built for the next 24 months. We have very manageable growth plans for 2019. And in fact, we need growth to absorb investments that were made related to capacity like airports and training facilities. Our operations are excellent. Our brand and our customer ratings are very high and industry-leading. Our culture of course is unmatched and our ability to attract talented people in this falling employment environment is very strong. And then finally, and I think most importantly, we have a low cost DNA. We have a proven track record of managing not just cost, but industry-leading profits and margins and returns. And in the meantime, again assuming nothing unforeseen, we'll continue our focus on excellent shareholder returns. So with that, hopefully helpful perspective, let me just turn the call over to Tom Nealon to take us through the commercial side here. ","Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Moving right into cost. Our third quarter CASM, excluding special items, increased 4.1% year-over-year, driven in part by a nearly 9% increase in our hedged fuel costs. Our hedged fuel price per gallon remains steady at $2.25, and that's despite an increase in market jet fuel prices during the quarter. Our hedged jet fuel remains in line with our guidance due to more material hedging gains that kicked in at higher prices. The $0.04 net hedge benefit consisted of $0.10 of hedging gains offset by $0.06 of premium costs. For fourth quarter and based on market prices last Friday and given our hedging positions, we expect our fuel price per gallon to be in the $2.30 to $2.35 range. This guidance includes an estimated $0.07 net hedging benefit, including $0.14 of hedging gains, offset by $0.07 of premium costs. The $0.10 sequential increase in our estimated fourth quarter fuel price normalizing for the hedging gain is largely due to the increase in market prices. For 2019, we are also well prepared with a 63% hedge in protection beginning at $70 Brent crude equivalent with more material gains that kick in at $80 per barrel and continue to increase well above $100 per barrel. Our 2019 hedges are a mix of WTI and Brent crude oil and are structured so that we fully participate in market price decline. For full year 2019, based on market prices last Friday and our current hedging positions, we expect our economic fuel price per gallon to be in the $2.35 to $2.40 range, with an estimated $0.08 hedging gain and $0.04 premium cost. We expect 2019 fuel hedge premium costs which is included in fuel and oil expense to be approximately $80 million or $0.04 per gallon and down from this year. As Mike said, we continue to benefit from increased fuel efficiency from our fleet modernization. Our third quarter available seat mile per gallon, which is our key fuel efficiency metric, improved by 1.1% year-over-year. As I mentioned last quarter, our fuel efficiency improvement is slightly behind our 2018 goal of 2% to 3%, primarily due to our utilization of the -700 fleet to cover our fleet deficit and suboptimal flight schedule. As our schedule becomes more optimized and as we take on more MAX aircraft and began the retirement cycle of the 700, we expect the fuel efficiency profile of our fleet to continue to improve. In fact, I expect sequential improvement in our fourth quarter year-over-year fuel efficiency more in line with what we were expecting for the full year. I'm going to move on to third and fourth quarter non-fuel costs, and I'll talk in more detail about 2019 at the end of my prepared remarks. When you strip out fuel profit sharing and special items, our unit cost at inflation in third quarter was in line with our expectations. As we previously disclosed in our investor update, our third quarter unit costs were impacted by weather-related flight cancellations, resulting in about 1 point reduction in ASM. When combined with modest weather-related costs, the flight cancellations resulted in a nearly 1 point year-over-year negative impact to CASM. We ended up at the lower end of our CASM guidance, primarily due to approximately $10 million of spending that shifted into the fourth quarter and beyond. The shifts are primarily due to the timing of maintenance events and technology spending. Aside from shifting, the other cost categories were pretty much in line with expectations. Our fourth quarter year-over-year CASM outlook looks good, particularly from the easier comparisons that we had with last year's tax reform year-end bonus. Despite some cost pressure from shifting of spend out of the first half and third quarter, fourth quarter year-over-year CASM, excluding fuel special items and profit sharing is expected to be flat to up 1%. We've also had some capacity cuts here in fourth quarter, so we do have some related cost pressures. Netting out the moving parts, our full year 2018 CASM, excluding fuel profit sharing and special items remains unchanged. Our balance sheet remains very strong and investment-grade credit rating and with ample liquidity and we also have very healthy cash flows. Our year-to-date operating cash flow was $3.9 billion. We've invested $1.4 billion back into the business thus far in 2018. And for full year 2018 CapEx, we continue to expect to be in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion range and we are planning for a similar level of CapEx for 2019. So far, in 2018, we've returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through $1.5 billion in share repurchases and $332 million in dividends. This includes the $500 million accelerated share repurchase we launched in the third quarter and just completed earlier this month. This most recent ASR completed our previous $2 billion share repurchase authorization and the first $150 million from our new $2 billion authorization. So we have $1.85 billion remaining. Over the past five years, we've returned nearly all of our free cash flow through share repurchases and dividends, supporting our commitment to returning significant value to our shareholders. So overall, I'm very pleased with our continued approach to capital deployment with appropriate balance. We intend to continue investing back in the business while focusing on opportunities to drive further value, and we continue to have great opportunities to do so in particular with further investments in fleet modernization. Barring unforeseen circumstances, we also intend to continually return value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends with our excess cash. Regarding our fleet plan, we made some slight tweaks to our order book recently. First as planned, we took delivery of five Boeing 737-800 aircraft and seven MAX 8s in the quarter and we continue to expect to end the year with 751 aircraft. During third quarter, we signed leases on an additional four MAX 8 aircraft with delivery in 2019. We still have 27 firm orders with Boeing for 737 MAX 7 and MAX 8 aircraft next year, and now we have seven leased MAX 8s coming next year as well for a total of 34 aircraft in 2019. As we've previously shared, we're planning to designate some of our 737-700 aircraft for retirement next year to support our continued investment in fleet modernization. These additional aircraft acquisitions or any future opportunities to pick up a few additional new aircraft for fleet replacement do not change our previously communicated 2019 capacity plan. On the capacity side, with the storm cancellations in the third quarter, we are now planning for our 2018 capacity to increase approximately 4% with fourth quarter ASMs up in the 6% to 6.5% range year-over-year. And we continue to plan for 2019 capacity to increase no more than 5% year-over-year, which is unchanged. Our schedule is currently published through early June 2019, and they exclude expected Hawaii flying. You can see that excluding Hawaii, our January through May year-over-year ASM growth is modest. In regards to 2019 cost, and as Gary mentioned, we are expecting full year 2019 CASM excluding fuel and profit sharing to increase at least 3% year-over-year. The key drivers of our year-over-year unit cost pressures in 2019 are primarily due to operation, staffing demand and healthcare inflation, which is driving an increase in salary, wages and benefits. Increased maintenance expense, driven in part by expected timing of maintenance events. Airport cost increase is driven in part by airport infrastructure investments and continued heavy investments in technology focused primarily on operational investments. Much of the cost inflation we are seeing here in the second half 2018 is continuing into next year. Of course, I'm adjusting our current fourth quarter 2018 unit cost trends for higher fourth quarter capacity growth, as well as fourth quarter 2017's tax reform employee bonus and charitable contribution, which was about 3 points to fourth quarter 2017. So our current growth rate continues into next year and we will shift our number one focus to control cost in 2019 to arrest that trend. In closing, we had an excellent third quarter and we were able to expand our net margin and deliver record third quarter earnings per share. These are notable achievements in the industry and I'd like to thank our more than 58,000 employees for their outstanding efforts. I'm very pleased with our rebound in revenue trends in third quarter and our continued momentum thus far in fourth quarter. Our fuel hedging gains have offset a significant portion of higher market jet fuel prices so far this year and we'll continue to provide protection, especially if prices continue to rise. While we face some unit cost inflation next year, I believe we have great opportunities ahead of us to more efficiently scale our growth and drive further productivity and efficiencies and this will be a primary focus for us next year. We strive to continue delivering very healthy margins as we continue to invest in our future. We continue to deliver high returns on invested capital and that will remain a top priority. With that Abby, we are ready to take questions. ",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2018/10/26/southwest-airlines-co-luv-q3-2018-earnings-confere.aspx
